\begin_layout Section
Households
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of the household is to choose optimal amounts of savings and
 expenditure, and within the expenditure, choose the different types of
 goods they consume.
 A particularly important good is housing as the model must replicate several
 important features of the data.
 These features include moments at aggregate level and life cycle profiles
 of housing ownership, mortgage debt, non-housing wealth, non-housing consumptio
n, and the intertemporal marginal propensity to consume out of different
 shocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The household problem contains several building blocks and we start by presentin
g the baseline case first.
 Afterwards, we outline in detail how household income is defined, how the
 financial portfolio is constructed, how the optimal decomposition of non-housin
g consumption occurs, and how bequests are allocated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic definitions

\begin_layout Standard
The model is a discrete-time, perfect foresight, overlapping generations
 model of the life cycle.
 The size of the cohort aged 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 and is exogenous.
 The household problem is to choose an optimal consumption path over the
 life cycle given its income path.
 The income path is endogenous as the household decides also on its participatio
n in the labor market.
 However, as labor disutility is separable from other utility, we can treat
 this choice in isolation and it is thus discussed in the labor market chapter.
 Furthermore, consumption of different non-housing goods is the result of
 a CES nest optimization sequence which relates to the input/output structure
 of the data, detailed in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first-order condition for savings can be obtained by replacing the non-housi
ng consumption variable with the budget constraint in the Bellman equation,
 eq.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Bellman"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

), and choosing end of period stock of assets 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 We obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{U_{a,t}^{c}}{p_{t}^{c}}=\beta\left\{ s_{a,t}\left(1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}\right)\frac{U_{a+1,t+1}^{c}}{p_{t+1}^{c}}+s_{a,t}\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Wealth}}{\partial B_{a,t}}+\left(1-s_{a,t}\right)\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Beq}}{\partial B_{a,t}}\right\} \label{eq:FOC_s}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}$
\end_inset

 is the marginal rate of return,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}=\frac{\partial\left(r_{t+1}B_{a,t}\right)}{\partial B_{a,t}}
\]

\end_inset

Equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:FOC_s"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) is a standard Euler equation, wherein the household trades-off current
 with future marginal utility of consumption.
 On the left hand side, the last unit of income used for current consumption
 yields 
\begin_inset Formula $1/p_{t}^{c}$
\end_inset

 units of consumption with marginal utility 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a,t}^{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Optimality implies this must be identical to what is obtained from alternativel
y saving this marginal unit of income, earning a net marginal return 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}$
\end_inset

, and using it next period for consumption, taking into account that one
 may die.
 This is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}\right)\frac{U_{a+1,t+1}^{c}}{p_{t+1}^{c}}
\]

\end_inset

weighed by the survival rate 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 and discounted by the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 to match the current marginal utility.
 In addition, a surviving household will also derive the utility of the
 ownership of the extra wealth.
 On the other hand, in the chance 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-s_{a,t}\right)$
\end_inset

 that a household does not survive, it obtains the marginal change in bequest
 utility, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial V_{a,t}^{Beq}/\partial B_{a,t}$
\end_inset

, measured in the future and discounted back for mechanical consistency,
 as in case of death the agent only dies tomorrow (and therefore after the
 current savings decision).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*

\series bold
Terminal savings condition (last period of life)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The household lives up to 100 years of age.
 The survival rate is thus zero in the last age, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{A,t}=0$
\end_inset

, but bequests still occur.
 We obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{U_{A,t}^{c}}{p_{t}^{c}}=\beta\frac{\partial V_{A,t}^{Beq}}{\partial B_{A,t}},
\]

\end_inset

which determines assets at the end of life.
 However, setting the survival rate at zero induces an abrupt change in
 behavior at the end of life that distorts the optimal choice due to the
 truncation of life.
 We instead use the following equation where the survival rate is the actual
 rate observed at 100 years of age, 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{A,t}\neq0$
\end_inset

, and where we replace the would-be consumption of 101-year-olds with the
 consumption of next period's 100-year-olds:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{U_{A,t}^{c}}{p_{t}^{c}}=\beta\left\{ s_{A,t}\left(1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}\right)\frac{U_{A,t+1}^{c}}{p_{t+1}^{c}}+s_{A,t}\frac{\partial V_{A,t}^{Wealth}}{\partial B_{A,t}}+\left(1-s_{A,t}\right)\frac{\partial V_{A,t}^{Beq}}{\partial B_{A,t}}\right\}

Housing

\end_inset

 is a stock variable.
 Like the choice of

 intertemporal first-order condition.
 The general expression for this condition is
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Just as in the savings optimal choice, this equation needs to be adjusted
 in the final age of life.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{U_{a,t}^{c}}{p_{t}^{c}}\left(\frac{\partial f_{a,t}}{\partial D_{a,t}}\right)=U_{a,t}^{d}+\beta s_{a,t}\frac{\partial U_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}+\beta s_{a,t}\frac{U_{a+1,t+1}^{c}}{p_{t+1}^{c}}\left(1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{D}-\frac{\partial f_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
+\beta s_{a,t}\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Wealth}}{\partial D_{a,t}}+\beta\left(1-s_{a,t}\right)\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Beq}}{\partial D_{a,t}}\label{eq:FOC_d}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{r}_{t+1}^{D}=\frac{\partial r_{t+1}B_{a,t}}{\partial D_{a,t}}
\]

\end_inset

and where the presence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial U_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}$
\end_inset

 reflects the fact that the housing habit is internalized.
 This condition reads: when you sacrifice 
\begin_inset Formula $1/p_{t}^{c}$
\end_inset

 units of non-durable consumption today and use the money to buy extra housing,
 there is an immediate marginal utility loss from reduced consumption.
 This is the left-hand side of the equation.
 On the right-hand side, you gain the direct marginal utility of the durable
 good, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a,t}^{d}$
\end_inset

, and tomorrow you gain the marginal utility of non-durable consumption
 associated with the effect of the additional housing bought today on tomorrow's
 income, conditional on surviving.
 The direct effect of housing on tomorrow's budget is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{\partial f_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}$
\end_inset

.
 Housing decisions may also affect tomorrow's budget through portfolio choices
 that change the rate of return on 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, which is captured by 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{r}_{t+1}^{D}$
\end_inset

, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In the case of not surviving, you instead gain bequest utility in period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Putting the two together
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

), to get an expression for the user-cost of housing.
 .
 Here we merge them by eliminating the marginal utility of consumption in
 period t+1, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a+1,t+1}^{c}$
\end_inset

.
 We obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{gather*}
\frac{U_{a,t}^{c}}{p_{t}^{c}}\left\{ \frac{\partial f_{a,t}}{\partial D_{a,t}}+\frac{1}{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}}\frac{\partial f_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}-\frac{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{D}}{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}}\right\} =U_{a,t}^{d}+\beta s_{a,t}\frac{\partial U_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}\\
+\beta s_{a,t}\left[\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Wealth}}{\partial D_{a,t}}-\frac{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{D}-\frac{\partial f_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}}{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}}\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Wealth}}{\partial B_{a,t}}\right]\\
+\beta\left(1-s_{a,t}\right)\left[\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Beq}}{\partial D_{a,t}}-\frac{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{D}-\frac{\partial f_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}}{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}}\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Beq}}{\partial B_{a,t}}\right]
\end{gather*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This yields the user-cost of housing expression measured at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 such that it is comparable to the current consumption price:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{a,t}^{ucD}=\underbrace{\left\{ \frac{\partial f_{a,t}}{\partial D_{a,t}}+\frac{1}{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}}\frac{\partial f_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}-\frac{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{D}}{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}}\right\} }_{\text{User-cost of \ensuremath{D_{a,t}} measured at time t in nominal units.}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This merged equation has an intuitive reading.
 When the household sacrifices one unit of current consumption to buy additional
 housing, it must weigh the direct marginal utility of housing 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a,t}^{d}$
\end_inset

 against the loss of marginal utility of consumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a,t}^{c}$
\end_inset

, net of the gain in the marginal utility of wealth and bequests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also merge the two first-order conditions by eliminating the current
 marginal utility of consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a,t}^{c}$
\end_inset

.
 This is useful because, given the assumptions we make regarding utility
 of wealth and bequests
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Specifically we use that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Beq}}{\partial D_{a,t}}=\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Beq}}{\partial B_{a,t}}\frac{\partial f_{a,t}}{\partial D_{a,t}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Wealth}}{\partial D_{a,t}}=\frac{\partial V_{a,t}^{Wealth}}{\partial B_{a,t}}\frac{\partial f_{a,t}}{\partial D_{a,t}}$
\end_inset

, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Consumption-utility"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, we can also eliminate marginal utility of wealth and bequests from the
 resulting condition:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{a,t}^{d}+\beta s_{a,t}\frac{\partial U_{a+1,t+1}}{\partial D_{a,t}}=\beta s_{a,t}p_{a,t}^{ucD}\frac{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}}{p_{t+1}^{c}}U_{a+1,t+1}^{c}
\]

\end_inset

The intuition here is also clear.
 An additional unit of housing today yields the corresponding direct marginal
 utility of housing (adjusted for habit).
 This must be identical to the marginal utility of consumption we could
 obtain tomorrow if instead of spending the money on housing we took that
 amount of money, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{a,t}^{ucD}$
\end_inset

, capitalized it 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1+\overline{r}_{t+1}^{B}}{p_{t+1}^{c}}$
\end_inset

, and used it to eat in case we survive.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Optimal labor search decisions start at age 16, and this is possible because,
 by eliminating wealth effects from the labor decision we make the two problems

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Fitting the budget constraint of these children is important, as it allows
 us to calibrate initial wealth at 18 years of age correctly and correct
 for otherwise excessive consumption of the associated parental household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than modeling children as optimizing agents, we let their consumption
 be implicit in the parent's problem and create an exogenous income transfer
 variable from parents to children that will fit the child's budget constraint
 at zero consumption and is just enough to hit the asset target at age 18.
 Children are born with zero assets, and for a few ages, they actually have
 recorded disposable income, so their budget constraints are given by

The housing the household buys and sells is an aggregate of "bricks" and
 land.
 The "bricks" part of the house is produced mainly with inputs purchased
 from the construction sector.
 The country's entire stock of land is held by households embodied in their
 housing good.
 Land available for the construction of new houses is the land released
 as a result of housing depreciation.

 An intermediary buys output from the construction sector and other intermediate
 inputs, buys land from households released from depreciated housing, packages
 these together, and sells the resulting houses back to households.
 Land is introduced in MAKRO as a rigid production factor.
 In reality, land is a somewhat flexible factor, and we allow for exogenous
 increases in the aggregate stock.

We introduce an exogenous supply of rental accommodation, 
\begin_inset Formula $H$

, including an exogenous rent, to capture the non-negligible amount of existing

The costs and returns of housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Owned housing is the overwhelming source of household debt, and housing
 finance is a significant fraction of total financial activity.
 Houses here are financed with a mortgage with an age-specific fraction
 of mortgage financing to house value, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{a,t}$
\end_inset

, as a loan-to-value (LTV) term.
 The object 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is exogenous to the household, but is modeled so that mortgages only gradually
 adjust to housing prices.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Endogenous mortgage ratios require the specification of mortgage contracts
 and a model of credit.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Therefore, the model generates quantities for mortgage debt that change
 via the extensive margin (as the stock of housing changes) and via movements
 in prices when the extensive margin is constant.

Hidden user costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We incorporate an additional component in the user cost of housing to reflect
 the fact that houses have historically provided a higher but more volatile
 return than relatively risk free bond rates.
 As we cannot model stochastic returns while keeping the model tractable
 we instead add a risk premium directly (just as we do in the required return
 of equity).
 The term may also capture costs related to asymmetric information risk
 and other transaction costs.
 In our implementation, the risk premium raises the average user cost even
 though we do not account for them in the budget constraint and help the
 model fit the data.

 There may be theoretical reasons to think portfolio composition should
 vary over the life cycle.
 If the data contains such heterogeneity, the estimated parameters will
 reflect that by having different values for different assets.
 In addition, the estimated portfolio is an optimal portfolio given the
 underlying assumption is that agents made optimal decisions that resulted
 in the portfolios we observe in the data.

Reference consumption - HtM consumption and habits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent evidence on inter-temporal consumption behavior shows that following
 a one-time transfer, consumption rises for several periods with a mean
 on-impact yearly marginal propensity to consume (MPC) of roughly 50 percent,
 see Fagereng et.
 al.
 2021.
 This is inconsistent with the typical business cycle models; the standard
 way to match high on-impact MPC's has been to combine a share of Ricardian
 agents with a share of “hand-to-mouth” (HtM) agents who consume all income
 in every period (e.g.
 Bilbiie 2008).
 This, however, only generates high on-impact marginal propensities to consume
 but no effects in the following periods (as the Ricardian agents have close
 to zero MPC's for transitory shocks), and is thus contrary to empirical
 evidence showing significant year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 effects.
 Recent business cycle literature has solved this by introducing microeconomic
 stochasticity and incomplete markets (Heterogeneous-Agent New-Keynesian,
 HANK, models), in which agents close to but not at their borrowing constraint
 will have high MPC's and smooth consumption.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In order to get enough initial period impact the literature contains different
 approaches such as two assets (Kaplan et al., 2018), discount factor heterogenei
ty (e.g.
 Hagedorn et al.
 2019), or a generalized habit (Carroll et al.
 (2023)).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Here, we implement a solution that does not rely on stochasticity.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that it is possible to solve a particular class of HANK models without
 numerical stochasticity by assuming zero-liquidity (zero savings), see
 e.g.
 Bilbiie 2020.
 This is not possible in our case, since we want to match the model to the
 rich features of wealth in data.
 Also note that a recent strand of literature obtains empirically realistic
 inter-temporal MPC's, see e.g.
 Angeletos et al.
 (2024), by building on a perpetual youth OLG model alla Blanchard (1985)
 with very high probabilities of death.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In particular, we combine a representative agent model with consumption
 habits, as is typical in the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)
 literature, with a share of reference consumption that tracks (liquid)
 income, and therefore generates a high on-impact MPC while also generating
 persistence (year 
\begin_inset Formula $t+1$
\end_inset

 effects) due to habits.
 The idea of including income as a term in reference consumption was first
 presented in Carroll et al.
 (2023).
 We refer to this component as HtM consumption.
 The resulting high MPC behavior can be interpreted in various ways.
 For example, high on-impact spending of a transitory income shock is typically
 explained by liquidity constraints in the two-agent New-Keynesian literature
 (TANK), e.g., models with hand-to-mouth consumers and the HANK literature.
 A different contender for high first-period excess spending that does not
 rely on liquidity constraints is durable (non-housing) purchases.
 Durables have layouts that are more front-loaded due to the long-lasting
 consumption flow of the stock cf.
 Laibson et al.
 (2022).

 Regarding utility from wealth, once households reach a certain age, they
 can freely choose the payout schedule from 'Kapitalpension' and 'aldersopsparin
g'.
 Many choose to withdraw at the latest possible date, 20 years after retirement,
 when the whole amount is paid out at once.

Disutility of house price changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To better account for house price momentum (positive autocorrelation in
 price changes), we introduce a disutility of house price changes that captures
 various factors affecting buyers' and sellers' decisions.
 This price momentum can be micro-founded in various ways following the
 literature on house price sensitivity.
 For example, when selling a house, reference price utility, as described
 in Barberis and Xiong (2012), leads households to experience disutility
 from selling below the purchase price.
 Sellers may also be loss-averse in reference pricing, incentivizing them
 to hold house prices higher for longer than optimal given actual demand,
 in order to avoid the marginal loss discontinuity at the reference point.
 Additionally, demand concavity, as observed in Guren (2018), means that
 if prices fall below a certain threshold, demand does not increase (since
 households typically only need one house).
 Finally, downsizing aversion, due to financial constraints such as the
 need for a down-payment on a new house, as described in Stein (1995), may
 further discourage sellers from lowering their prices.
 These effects have been shown to be important in Danish data on the seller
 side, as documented in Andersen et al.
 (2022).
 On the other hand, for buyers, recent sale prices and expected profits
 may serve as reference points for making purchasing decisions.
 Bao and Saunders (2021) found, based on micro-data from the UK housing
 market, that buyers use these reference points to guide their purchase
 behavior.
 We aim to capture these various incentives in the following way;

 In the national accounts these costs are used to produce financial services

 consumption of services.
 The aggregate consumption of services include these financial services

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Tourism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are both imports and exports of tourism.
 Imports of tourism consist of how much Danish households consume abroad
 and are given by the demand component 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\text{tourism},t}$
\end_inset

 from the tree above.
 This is a regular consumption good and its demand increases with income.
 Exports of tourism are determined in the exports chapter and its aggregate
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\text{tourism},t}$
\end_inset

.
 The consumption of foreign tourists in Denmark is also divided into consumption
 groups in the export chapter and is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{c,t}^{Tourist}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Total consumption of goods type 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 in Denmark is the sum of Danish households' consumption and tourists' consumpti
on in Denmark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{c,t}^{CDK}C_{c,t}^{DK}=P_{c,t}^{C}C_{c,t}+P_{c,t}^{CTourist}C_{c,t}^{Tourist}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input/output system is based on deliveries from the 9 production sectors
 to demand groups (see input/ouput chapter).
 The demand groups for consumption include tourists' consumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{c,t}^{DK}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whereas in the model Danes and tourists face the same prices for the same
 goods, in order to match the data they cannot face the same price for the
 same consumption components.
 We therefore use an adjustment factor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{c,t}^{CTourist}=\lambda_{c,t}^{pCTourist}P_{c,t}^{C}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{c,t}^{pCTourist}$
\end_inset

 is a parameter used to fit the data.
 It is assumed that this price margin remains constant going forward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of aggregate Danish consumption does not include the consumption
 of foreign tourists in Denmark (as these are counted as exports).

An individual of any given age receives bequests from agents deceased also

 The distribution of bequests is modeled through a time varying matrix

 where the indices refer respectively to the age of the deceased and to
 the age of the heir.
 This allocation matrix is general in that it encompasses all deaths, not

The sample is larger than in Boserup, Kopczuk, and Kreiner, (2016).

\begin_layout Standard
The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{t}(a_{d},a_{h})$
\end_inset

 is based on estimates of individual bequests from Danish administrative
 data.
 These estimates are obtained using a difference-in-difference estimator.
 This measures how the difference in wealth of an individual of age 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{h}$
\end_inset

, whose relative of age 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{d}$
\end_inset

 has died, differs from the the difference in wealth of the average person
 of age 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{h}$
\end_inset

.
 This results in estimates of several specific bequests from 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{d}$
\end_inset

 year old individuals to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{h}$
\end_inset

 year old individuals.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 be the index for each specific transfer from an 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{d}$
\end_inset

 year old to an 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{h}$
\end_inset

 year old.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{H}_{a_{d},a_{h},i,t}$
\end_inset

 is then the estimated nominal amount transferred for each specific transfer.
 These bequests given by individuals in age group 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{d}$
\end_inset

 to individuals in age group 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{h}$
\end_inset

 are then summed and divided by the total number of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{d}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{h}$
\end_inset

 year olds (not just the ones involved in estimated bequest transfers but
 all individuals).
 The result is a data frame containing the average bequest 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{a_{d},a_{h},t}$
\end_inset

 received by an 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{h}$
\end_inset

 year old from an 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{d}$
\end_inset

 year old, regardless of whether a relative has died,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{a_{d},a_{h},t}=\frac{1}{N_{a_{h},t}N_{a_{d},t}}\left[\underbrace{\sum_{i}\widetilde{H}_{a_{d},a_{h},i,t}}_{\text{All transfers \ensuremath{a_{d}}to \ensuremath{a_{h}}}}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{x,t}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $x$

This share contains a large amount of noise.
 We therefore conduct a non-parametric estimation, using a local linear
 regression with the age of both giver and receiver as dependent variables
 and a Gaussian kernel.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{\chi}_{a_{d},a_{h}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a_{d},a_{h}}N_{a_{h},t}$
\end_inset

 will generally not sum to 1.
 This means that bequests given will not be the same as bequests received.
 To prevent this, the shares are normalized so that we finally obtain the
 allocation matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{t}\left(a_{d},a_{h}\right)=\frac{\chi_{a_{d},a_{h}}}{\sum_{a_{h}}\chi_{a_{d},a_{h}}N_{a_{h},t}}

 This means that the average bequest given by a member of age group

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-s_{a_{d},t}\right)B_{a_{d},t}$

\begin_layout Standard
The model generates the net financial variable 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

 endogenously.
 In the data this quantity is made up of the sum of different assets (stocks,
 bonds and bank deposits) minus the sum of liabilities (bank debt), so that
 in gross term 
\begin_inset Formula $B=A-L$
\end_inset

.
 This decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 into assets and liabilities displays systematic patterns over the life
 cycle, and here we detail how to capture these features and use them in
 our model.
 We first look at a very simple example to highlight the approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Assets and Liabilities as functions of B
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exogenous portfolio composition is estimated from the data as in the
 following example with one asset and one liability.
 This allows us to take into account that 1) portfolios change with age
 and 2) portfolios change with the size of net-savings.
 Assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 are related to net financial wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 through the equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{a,t}=I_{A}+\lambda B_{a,t}
\]

\end_inset

and we have the same for liabilities
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{a,t}=I_{L}+\phi B_{a,t}
\]

\end_inset

and here the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 are cohort averages, and therefore the quantities that apply to individual
 households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{a,t}-L_{a,t}=B_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 we must have that our estimated parameters obey 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{L}=I_{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda-\phi=1$
\end_inset

.
 As it turns out these properties are ensured by the mechanics of OLS estimation.
 The OLS regressions are 
\begin_inset Formula $A=X\beta_{A}+\epsilon_{A}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $L=X\beta_{L}+\epsilon_{L}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 are column vectors.
 Taking the estimator for assets, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{A}=(X'X)^{-1}X'A$
\end_inset

, and using the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $A=B+L$
\end_inset

, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{A}=(X'X)^{-1}X'B+\hat{\beta}_{L}$
\end_inset

.
 Here, since the matrix X has two column vectors, a column of ones and the
 vector B, the OLS algebra implies 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{\beta}_{A}-\hat{\beta}_{L}=(X'X)^{-1}X'B=\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
1
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

In a regression 
\begin_inset Formula $A=X\beta+\epsilon$
\end_inset

 the OLS estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 projected 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 on the space generated by the columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, containing the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $A-L=B$
\end_inset

 the sum across equations of coefficients attached to B must be 1 and the
 sum of coefficients attached to any other variables must be 0, because
 the projection of B on B is exact.
 These properties extend to the case where the regressions have explanatory
 variables so that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 has more columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OLS is adequate as the relationships we are estimating are not behavioral.
 They are instead a way to capture the patterns observed in the data more
 accurately than just using averages as done in e.g.
 DREAM.
 For historical data we add the OLS error to the estimated regression so
 as to replicate the portfolio data exactly.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
OLS is unbiased.
 A GLS estimator with weights given by population 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a}$
\end_inset

 is more efficient in the presence of age related heteroeskedasticity.
 However, the error from this estimator, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y-X\hat{\beta}_{GLS}$
\end_inset

, no longer sums to zero.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For forward looking simulation we leave the orthogonal error (which has
 mean zero across ages and across assets) out, and use the estimated parameters,
 plus endogenous 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and any other explanatory variables inside 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 to generate a portfolio going forward.
 Note that the estimation procedure and the exact specification of these
 equations are agnostic (given the specification assumed) with respect to
 the data.
 There may be theoretical reasons to think portfolio composition should
 vary over the life cycle.
 If the data contains such heterogeneity, the estimated parameters will
 reflect that by having different values for different assets.
 In addition, the estimated portfolio is an optimal portfolio given the
 underlying assumption is that agents made optimal decisions that resulted
 in what we observe.

Homogeneity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now briefly drop the time subscript.
 In OLS regression terminology, the objects Y and X are (for asset 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

) given by 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=\left[A_{a}^{i}\right]$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $X$

 containing four column variables (intercept, age, Z, and B) with as many
 rows as ages 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{Q}{N}, & \frac{Q}{S^{a}}a, & Z_{a}, & B_{a}\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

The way the intercept terms are defined plays a role in ensuring homogeneity
 of degree 1 in the model.
 Homogeneity of degree 1 is ensured if, when increasing all exogenous variables
 by a common factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\varLambda$
\end_inset

, the model yields all endogenous variables factored by the same 
\begin_inset Formula $\varLambda$
\end_inset

 such that no relative quantities change.
 Consider the equation for asset 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{i}$
\end_inset

 and aggregate over all ages 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and all households 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a}$

 Inserting the intercept we have

which, after canceling terms, yields
\begin_inset Formula

\]

\end_inset

The portfolio structure only needs to ensure the homogeneity of aggregate
 (sum over all individuals and all cohorts) assets and liabilities with
 respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 The rest of the MAKRO model must then ensure that 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is homogeneous with respect to all other variables.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is a macro variable introduced as a scaling factor, the long-run portfolio
 composition is constant as long as MAKRO preserves the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $Q/B$
\end_inset

.
 The same is true for the ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $Z/B$
\end_inset

.
 However, policy interventions or structural changes that affect the long-run
 ratios 
\begin_inset Formula $Q/B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z/B$
\end_inset

 will affect long-run portfolio compositions.
 Of particular note are the scaling objects 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{a}$
\end_inset

, which ensure that the portfolio is homogeneous with respect to population
 size.

We include housing in the auxiliary variable Z in the regression since it

 Note that we implement the portfolio with one short-run deviation from

 We now detail the algebra associated with these features.
 Consider the equation for some asset 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

 It is estimated as
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

and aggregation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{a}N_{a,t}A_{a,t}^{i}=A_{t}^{i}$
\end_inset

 implies (where

nts 
\begin_inset Formula $(I_{0}^{i},I_{1}^{i})$
\end_inset

 are recovered ex post by inversion.
 For example for the intercept we estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\beta}_{0}^{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{I}_{0}^{i}=(N_{t}/Q_{t})\hat{\beta}_{0}^{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{p}_{t}^{D}$

\begin_inset Formula $I_{d}^{i}$

 As we implement this equation we define this price as a moving average:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{p}_{t}^{D}=\left(1-\kappa^{PD}\right)p_{t}^{D}+\kappa^{PD}\bar{p}_{t-1}^{D}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{t}^{D}$

Aggregation and long run properties, however, require some adjustment.
 As we aggregate 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{a}N_{a,t}A_{j,a,t}^{i}=A_{t}^{i}$

 the intercept and the age term become

 It is also not age dependent.
 This marginal rate helps characterize the user cost of housing in more

 The tasks that MAKRO will be used for also require that the sum of the
 wealth profiles over age correspond to the totals found in the national

 Such a data set was not available prior to the creation of the MAKRO life-cycle

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The administrative data used to create the wealth profiles is drawn from
 the Statistics Denmark's administrative data on wealth, with some additional

 Aggregate data on wealth is drawn from national accounts.
 Returns are based on aggregate data and the portfolio composition implied
 by the created asset profiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The asset profiles are created using two steps: First, a correspondence
 between the administrative data and the asset structure in MAKRO is established.
 Most asset and liability types in MAKRO have clear correspondences to the
 administrative data.
 This includes bank debt, deposits, real estate, mortgages, and bonds.
 In MAKRO stocks are divided into foreign and domestic stocks, but Statistics
 Denmark's wealth data only contains information on the combined value of
 stocks.
 Data from the Lovmodel database is therefore used to divide the combined
 value of stocks into foreign and domestic stocks.
 In the second step, the asset and liability profiles are then scaled proportion
ately to match the aggregate values from the national accounts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rates of return are calculated based on aggregate values from the national

 Combining the rates of return with the created asset and liability age

\begin_layout Standard
The housing 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 the household owns is an aggregate object containing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bricks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and land.
 The entire stock of land is held by households inside their housing good.
 An intermediary buys 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bricks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and buys land released from depreciated housing, packages these together
 and sells the resulting housing good to families.
 Here we make an important simplification to the model for practical reasons.
 As over time the exact composition of new housing in terms of bricks and
 land may change, so does the implicit composition in terms of bricks and
 land of the total housing holdings, and this affects households of different
 ages differently.
 We simplify the model by assuming that the composition of housing in terms
 of bricks and land is always identical for all households.
 This avoids having to trace two additional age specific stock variables
 (bricks and land) inside the household problem, and is similar to the assumptio
n used in the labor market where the age distribution of workers is the
 same in every firm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, inside the housing good 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bricks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 depreciate but land does not.
 Nevertheless, the depreciation rate of the housing object is still the
 depreciation rate of bricks, as the land associated with depreciated bricks
 is released and sold by the household.
 Therefore we account for the released land as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lost
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the normal law of motion
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{a,t}=D_{a,t}-\left(1-\delta_{t}^{bricks}\right)D_{a-1,t-1}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recover
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it as household revenues from land sales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One final detail is that new land is released into the economy every period.
 The aggregate land variable grows exogenously and this land growth is helicopte
r dropped on households proportionally to their individual land holdings.
 In order to settle the accounting of land sales we must determine the individua
l land holdings relative to aggregate land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individual households own the following fraction of total land:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{D_{a-1,t-1}\cdot N_{a-1,t-1}}{\sum_{a}D_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}}\right)\frac{1}{N_{a-1,t-1}}
\]

\end_inset

The term in brackets contains the fraction of total land held by the appropriate
 population group 
\begin_inset Formula $(a,t)$
\end_inset

.
 The second term is 1 over the size of that population.
 The product of the two yields the fraction of individual land holdings.
 Eliminating terms this equals 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{a-1,t-1}\varOmega_{t}^{Land}$
\end_inset

 where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varOmega_{t}^{Land}\equiv\frac{1}{\sum_{a}D_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}}=\frac{1}{D_{t-1}}
\]

\end_inset

Now we are ready to determine revenues from land sales.
 The total quantity of land being sold is the land released by housing depreciat
ion plus the helicopter land growth, 
\begin_inset Formula $Land_{t}^{sales}=\delta_{t}^{bricks}Land_{t-1}+Land_{t}-Land_{t-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Individual revenues from selling land are then given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{a-1,t-1}\cdot\varOmega_{t}^{Land}P_{t}^{Land}Land_{t}^{Sales}
\]

\end_inset

This quantity is now adapted to the model in the main text by defining the
 object 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{t}^{Land}$
\end_inset

.
 This is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha_{t}^{Land}=\frac{\varOmega_{t}^{Land}P_{t}^{Land}Land_{t}^{Sales}}{P_{t-1}^{D}}=\frac{P_{t}^{Land}Land_{t}^{Sales}}{P_{t-1}^{D}D_{t-1}}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{t}^{Land}$
\end_inset

 is the same for all households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final remark regarding depreciation is in order.
 Housing depreciation is endogenous in the data.
 Maintenance investments prolong the life of a house.
 Such investments are choices and either consist of home production or of
 purchases from small to medium size service providers such as plumbers
 and carpenters.
 This is a simple model extension which we have developed and can later
 be included in MAKRO if necessary.

 A temporary increase in house prices should trigger a strong fall in investment.
 A permanent one not necessarily so.
 We use a slightly more general way of writing this factor as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Gamma_{a,t}^{p}=\left(1-\phi\right)+\phi\frac{D_{a,t}-\left(1-\delta^{d}\right)D_{a-1,t-1}}{D_{a,t}}=1-\phi\left(1-\delta^{d}\right)\frac{D_{a-1,t-1}}{D_{a,t}}

as it allows for a degree of control over the influence of the endogenous
 housing decision on the mortgage ratios.

While in the data immigrants and emigrants are different from the average
 household in most respects, the model is nevertheless bound by the necessity
 to fit all agents into an average that can be replicated.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Non migrants are also heterogeneous and yet only their average by age is

 The household model has one dimension of heterogeneity which is age.
 Any additional heterogeneity is eliminated.

The goal is then to generate average quantities of assets

 In the labor market chapter we detail the assumptions and mechanics needed
 to generate average employment, and here we detail the aggregation of assets

 We therefore assume that migrants carry with them the necessary assets
 to appropriately fit the resulting average.
 That is not the only assumption required, so we first work through an aggregati

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Aggregation without housing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We 
\series bold
first
\series default
 detail the budget constraint of three groups of households.
 Surviving residents 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}-E_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 have the budget constraint where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{a,t}\equiv y_{a,t}-P_{t}^{C}C_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 and where we have added a transfer term 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a,t}^{S}$
\end_inset

 (superscript S for stayers):
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{a,t}-x_{a,t}=\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{S}
\]

\end_inset

The people who leave, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 receive/pay a transfer 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a,t}^{E}$
\end_inset

 before leaving.
 They do not earn income, consume or buy end-of-period assets in the country
 this period so that their constraint is simply a definition of the amount
 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 they carry abroad:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{a,t}\equiv\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{E}
\]

\end_inset

Finally, the people who enter the country, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 receive/pay a transfer 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a,t}^{I}$
\end_inset

 after arrival.
 This transfer and the assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 they bring into the country allow them to make identical choices to those
 of the first group (the stayers): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{a,t}-x_{a,t}=A_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{I}
\]

\end_inset

The 
\series bold
next
\series default
 step is to define some properties we need to impose.
 We choose to impose a zero net effect on the balance of payments.
 This implies the following relationship between households entering and
 exiting the country:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{a-1,t-1}=\frac{E_{a,t}}{I_{a,t}}M_{a,t}=\frac{E_{a,t}}{I_{a,t}}\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}+\frac{E_{a,t}}{I_{a,t}}T_{a,t}^{E}
\]

\end_inset

We then impose that the transfer flows have zero net sum.
 This implies:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[s_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}-E_{a,t}\right]T_{a,t}^{S}+E_{a,t}T_{a,t}^{E}+I_{a,t}T_{a,t}^{I}=0
\]

\end_inset

and finally we impose equality of stayers and new arrivals which implies
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{a,t}^{I}=\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{S}-A_{a-1,t-1}
\]

\end_inset


\series bold
Now
\series default
 we can aggregate to obtain the budget constraint of the population, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a,t}$
\end_inset

, at each age.
 This is done in the following steps.
 Add surviving residents 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}-E_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 plus incomers
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N_{a,t}\left[B_{a,t}-x_{a,t}\right]=\left[s_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}-E_{a,t}\right]\left[\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{S}\right]+I_{a,t}\left[A_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{I}\right]
\]

\end_inset

replace the zero balance of payments relationship
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N_{a,t}\left[B_{a,t}-x_{a,t}\right]=\left[s_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}-E_{a,t}\right]\left[\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{S}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
+I_{a,t}\left[\frac{E_{a,t}}{I_{a,t}}\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}+\frac{E_{a,t}}{I_{a,t}}T_{a,t}^{E}+T_{a,t}^{I}\right]
\]

\end_inset

replace 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{I}$
\end_inset

 with the equality of stayers and incomers and collect terms to obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{a,t}-x_{a,t}=\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{S}
\]

\end_inset


\series bold
Finally
\series default
, determine the transfer payments 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 If we put together the relationships on zero balance of payments, zero
 net transfers, and the equality of stayers and new arrivals, we obtain
 that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{a,t}^{S}=-\frac{\left(I_{a,t}-E_{a,t}\right)}{N_{a,t}}\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{a,t}^{I}=\left(I_{a,t}-E_{a,t}\right)\left[\frac{1}{I_{a,t}}-\frac{1}{N_{a,t}}\right]\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}-\frac{E_{a,t}}{I_{a,t}}T_{a,t}^{E}
\]

\end_inset

and using this we can rewrite the aggregate budget constraint as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{a,t}-x_{a,t}=\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}\Gamma_{a,t}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Gamma_{a,t}=\frac{s_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}}{N_{a,t}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One last detail is that the transfer 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a,t}^{E}$
\end_inset

 is arbitrary and can be set at zero.
 These transfers are artificial constructions used to ensure new arrivals
 and surviving residents can make the same exact decisions subject to a
 balance of payments constraint which in this case is zero.
 They are added to the problem as a lump sum which is taken as exogenous
 by the household and do not affect marginal decisions.
 Furthermore, as all agents make identical choices within age, the only
 budget constraint that needs to be satisfied is the aggregate one, namely
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{a,t}-x_{a,t}=\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}\Gamma_{a,t}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Surviving residents

 have the budget constraint
\begin_inset Formula

B_{a,t}-x_{a,t}+\left(1-\mu_{a,t}\right)P_{t}^{D}D_{a,t}=\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}-\chi_{a,t}P_{t-1}^{D}D_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{S}

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\chi_{a,t}\equiv\left(1+r_{t}^{mort}\right)\mu_{a-1,t-1}+\tau_{t}^{W}+x_{t}-\frac{P_{t}^{D}}{P_{t-1}^{D}}\left(1-\delta_{t}^{d}\right)-\alpha_{t}^{Land}
\]

\end_inset

The people who leave, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 do not consume or work in the country, and sell their houses so that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{a,t}=-\left(1-\delta_{t}\right)D_{a-1,t-1}<0$
\end_inset

 and take their assets and proceedings abroad.
 Because they are downsizing, their budget constraint does not have a down
 payment fraction but rather keeps the entire proceeds of the sale.
 The final mortgage payment 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 liquidates the outstanding mortgage so that we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{a,t}\equiv\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}-\chi_{a,t}P_{t-1}^{D}D_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{E}
\]

\end_inset

and where 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the amount these agents will take abroad.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The people who enter the country, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{a,t}$

 have 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{a,t}=D_{a,t}>0$
\end_inset

 and they earn their income and consume here while they bring assets 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{a-1,t-1}$
\end_inset

 from abroad.
 Their housing expenditure is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-\mu_{a}\right)P_{t}^{D}D_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 Their full budget constraint is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{a,t}-x_{a,t}+\left(1-\mu_{a,t}\right)P_{t}^{D}D_{a,t}=A_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{I}
\]

\end_inset

We now impose the three conditions from above.
 Once again the zero balance of payments effect is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A_{a-1,t-1}=\frac{E_{a,t}}{I_{a,t}}M_{a,t}
\]

\end_inset

and the property that the transfer flows have zero net sum is also as above:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[s_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}-E_{a,t}\right]T_{a,t}^{S}+E_{a,t}T_{a,t}^{E}+I_{a,t}T_{a,t}^{I}=0
\]

\end_inset

and finally the equality of stayers and new arrivals now implies
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{a,t}^{I}=\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}-\chi_{a,t}P_{t-1}^{D}D_{a-1,t-1}+T_{a,t}^{S}-A_{a-1,t-1}
\]

\end_inset

Reproducing the same steps performed above we will find that we can set
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a,t}^{E}=0$
\end_inset

 and that we obtain the following objects.
 The aggregate budget constraint
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{a,t}+\left(1-\mu_{a,t}\right)P_{t}^{D}D_{a,t}=y_{a,t}-P_{t}^{C}C_{a,t}

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\end_inset

and the transfer
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{a,t}^{S}=-\frac{\left(I_{a,t}-E_{a,t}\right)}{N_{a,t}}\left[\left(1+r_{a,t}\right)B_{a-1,t-1}-\chi_{a,t}P_{t-1}^{D}D_{a-1,t-1}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and again the only budget constraint that needs to be satisfied is the aggregate
 one.

We can rearrange this into

f=\underbrace{\left(1-\mu_{a,t}\right)P_{t}^{D}D_{a,t}}_{\text{Out of pocket: new house equity}}-\left[\underbrace{\left(1-\delta_{t}^{d}\right)\frac{P_{t}^{D}}{P_{t-1}^{D}}-\mu_{a-1,t-1}}_{\text{exisiting house equity ratio}}\right]P_{t-1}^{D}D_{a-1,t-1}

The key feature is that an increase in house prices has a marginal effect
 which is not dragged down by the previous debt 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{a-1,t-1}.$
\end_inset

 We have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_{t}^{D}}=\underbrace{\left(1-\mu_{a,t}\right)D_{a,t}}_{\text{effect on new house equity}}-\underbrace{\left(1-\delta_{t}^{d}\right)D_{a-1,t-1}}_{\text{effect on exisiting house equity}}
\]

\end_inset

and since 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\delta>1-\mu$
\end_inset

 the cost of housing comes down when house prices increase.
 Therefore it is possible to buy extra housing.

Notice that there are no transaction costs which implies taking advantage
 of the leverage effect is costless.
 This potentially makes the leverage effect very powerful.

Now, this mechanism here is static.
 Rational agents are forward looking so they will not rush to buy more houses
 if prices are likely to fall in the future, which will happen if the cause
 of the increase in house prices is a temporary shock.
 As they antecipate capital losses they will dampen their current response
 to the price increase.

The leverage effect is 
\series bold
not
\series default
 the financial accelerator effect of Kyotaki and Moore (1997), or of Bernanke
 and Gertler (1995).
 In fact, the mortgage contract 
\series bold
worsens
\series default
 with an increase in house prices, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mu/\partial p<0$
\end_inset

, which makes it a stabilizer rather than an accelerator.
 An increase in house prices, even though it raises the value of your current
 house does not relax the mortgage financial constraint but rather tightens
 it.
 It does, however, allow the household to exploit an available (slightly
 worse) contract and buy more houses simply because the household now has
 more money and because 
\series bold
there exists
\series default
 an available debt contract.

Yet, MAKRO does have an accelerator in the KM and BG sense.
 It lies inside the utility from leaving a bequest and the utility of wealth.
 This object is a concave function of the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $B+p\left(1-\mu\right)D$
\end_inset

.
 This combined object has an admissible lower bound.
 If the household is near this lower bound, an increase in house prices
 allows liquid wealth 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to decrease, which allows households to consume more and buy more houses.
 The constraint has been relaxed by the house price increase, and here,
 buying extra housing relaxes the constraint next period also.
 This dynamic effect has all the hallmarks of the classic financial accelerator
 mechanism.
