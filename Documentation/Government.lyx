\begin_layout Standard
This chapter provides an overview of government revenues and expenditures.
 Several items on the expenditure side of the balance sheet are exogenous
 or obey exogenous relationships, such as fixed ratios to population or
 GDP.
 The same is true on the revenue side, as much of this side of the balance
 sheet amounts to determining the realized average tax rate on a particular
 item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of basic relationships are helpful to put forward here.
 First, the government budget surplus is the primary budget surplus plus
 net interest income,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Surplus = Primary Surplus + Net Interests}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and the primary surplus is the difference between revenues and expenditures
 (other than interest payments).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Primary Surplus = Revenues - Expenditures}
\]

\end_inset

Government revenue is the sum of direct taxation, indirect taxation and
 other government revenues:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Revenues}\equiv T_{t}=T_{t}^{Direct}+T_{t}^{Indirect}+T_{t}^{Other}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Direct taxes comprise around 60% of total tax revenues and are described
 in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Direct taxation"

\end_inset

, which covers many aspects of the Danish income tax system.
 Indirect taxes consist mainly of duties, VAT, and production taxes, as
 described in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Indirect taxation"

\end_inset

.
 Indirect taxes make up around 30% of tax revenues.
 The remaining taxes are described in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding notation, the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 stands for income and appears in different objects, tax rates are denoted
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, and tax revenues are given by the capital letter 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 For example, the sector-specific corporate tax rate is called 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{s,t}^{Corp}$
\end_inset

 and brings in the total revenue 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s,t}^{Corp}$
\end_inset

.
 Tax rates in the text, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, correspond to tax rates in the code 
\begin_inset Formula $t\times f$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is an adjustment variable to fit the data.
 These adjustments help match observed average tax rates, given the rate
 determined in the tax law.
 The adjustment factor is sometimes unnecessary and set to 1.
 Tax rates and adjustment factors are typically exogenous in MAKRO - if
 not it is explicitly mentioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where applicable, variables such as 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{t}^{Income}$
\end_inset

 represent sums over all cohorts, while corresponding variables with an
 age subscript, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a,t}^{Income}$
\end_inset

, represent cohort averages.
 The two variables are related by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{t}^{Income}=\sum_{a}N_{a,t}T_{a,t}^{Income}$
\end_inset

The only exceptions for tax revenues in this chapter are the taxes on the
 deceased and property tax.
 However, it does not apply in general as, in some cases, the base is the
 start-of-year population, and the flow of the deceased needs to be accounted
 for.

 for people in employment.
 It is a percentage of income up until a limit.
 It has the properties of a negative marginal tax for people with low income

 It is treated as a negative marginal tax, but with a tax rate equaling

 endogenously.
 Instead, we model only the total transfers received by age,

The fiscal sustainability indicator, in the model called HBI (holdbarhedsindikat

\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}=r_{\text{Bonds},t}^{Interest}+r_{\text{Bonds},t}^{Reval}=r_{\text{Bonds},t}^{Interest}$
\end_inset

 There is also a small correction for returns on assets different from the
 bond rate.

 Investing in assets with a higher return than bonds will in the current
