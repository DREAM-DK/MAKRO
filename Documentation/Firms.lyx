\begin_layout Standard
The economy has eight private sectors indexed by the subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in this chapter.
 These are agriculture (including fishing), construction, energy provision,
 extraction, housing, manufacturing (including food processing), shipping,
 and services (other than shipping).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firms maximize the present discounted value of profits.
 Solving this problem requires both cost minimization and optimal price
 setting.
 These two problems are separated into two sub-sectors - an intermediate
 sub-sector producing the goods and choosing inputs optimally, and another
 sub-sector where retail firms buy goods from producers, set prices and
 sell the same goods to the final consumers.
 The production and the price-setting decisions are separated both in the
 documentation and in the code.
 The production problem is given in this chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model's private sector firms use labor, capital, and intermediate goods
 as inputs.
 These inputs generate output through a production function which is a CES
 nest with multiple levels.
 Capital and intermediate goods can be bought from domestic firms or imported,
 and labor services are bought from supplying households.
 The market for intermediate inputs is a spot market and the optimal decision
 is static.
 The optimal decisions for labor and capital are dynamic, and the relevant
 price measures are user costs derived from intertemporal first-order conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user cost of labor is derived in the labor market chapter.
 The user cost of capital is derived here.
 Given the correct user cost measures, the problem of the firm can be solved
 by a sequence of static cost minimization problems at every level of the
 CES tree.
 Two bottom levels of the CES tree determine input demand for intermediate
 inputs and investment goods from all producing sectors and from foreign
 or domestic sources.
 These levels are separated from the problem of the firm and into the input/outp
ut system of market clearing relationships by interpreting them as intermediate
 transformation sectors with constant returns to scale technologies.
 These two levels are mainly data aggregation devices although we can also
 interpret them as behavioral objects.
 They are described in the input/output chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section delivers two demand components - intermediate inputs,
\begin_inset Formula $R_{s,t}$
\end_inset

, and investments, 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{i,s,t}$
\end_inset

 - to the input/output chapter.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The production function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Gross output 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is produced with capital equipment, 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{iM}$
\end_inset

, energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

, labor, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, capital structures (buildings) 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{iB}$
\end_inset

, and intermediate inputs 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
All inputs except intermediate inputs enter production in effective units
 which include factor utilization and in the case of labor, net of hiring
 costs.
 Effective capital inputs are denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{iM,s,t-1}^{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{iB,s,t-1}^{u}$
\end_inset

 (superscript 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 for utilization).
 Capital stocks are subject to a one period time to build which implies
 they are fixed in the short run (current period) although they can be used
 with varying intensity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
We write the general production function in sector 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
KELBR_{s,t}=Q\left(K_{iM,s,t-1}^{u},E_{sp,t},L_{s,t},K_{iB,s,t-1}^{u},R_{sp,t}\right)
\]

\end_inset

In what follows sector and time indices are omitted when that does not affect
 exposition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The CES tree
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Production inputs generate output through a CES nest structure where superscript
s 
\begin_inset Formula $K,E,L,B,R$
\end_inset

 denote equipment capital, energy, labor, structures, and intermediate inputs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center

\size small
\begin_inset Formula $\xymatrix{KELBR\left(KELB,R\right)\ar@{-}[dr]\ar@{-}[d]\\
KELB\left(KEL,K_{iB}\right)\ar@{-}[dr]\ar@{-}[d] & R\\
KEL\left(KE,L\right)\ar@{-}[dr]\ar@{-}[d] & K_{iB}\\
KE\left(K_{iM},E\right)\ar@{-}[dr]\ar@{-}[d] & L\\
K_{iM} & E
}
$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
CES cost minimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The optimal demand for inputs is obtained from solving a sequence of cost
 minimization problems at every level in the tree.
 As an example, the problem at the bottom branch of the upper tree is to
 minimize total cost 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{KE}KE=p^{K}K^{u}+p^{E}E$
\end_inset

 subject to 
\begin_inset Formula $KE=CES\left(K^{u},E\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The solution to this problem is well known and yields the following objects
 which, with the necessary extensions and appropriate indexing, translate
 appropriately to all levels of the tree:
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is easy to show that the CES structure also captures zero elasticities
 of substitution.
 The demand functions, constraint, and CES price all go through, while we
 never make use of the production function, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{KEL}=min(KE,L/\mu^{L})$
\end_inset

, and of course there are no derivatives but instead optimality implies
 
\begin_inset Formula $KE=L/\mu^{L}=KEL$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
\text{Output} & \Rightarrow & KE=\left[\left(1-\omega^{E}\right)^{\frac{1}{\eta}}\left(K^{u}\right)^{\frac{\eta-1}{\eta}}+\omega^{E}{}^{\frac{1}{\eta}}\left(E\right)^{\frac{\eta-1}{\eta}}\right]^{\frac{\eta}{\eta-1}}\\
\\
\text{Derivative} & \Rightarrow & \frac{\partial KE}{\partial E}=\left[\omega^{E}\frac{KE}{E}\right]^{\frac{1}{\eta}}\\
\\
\text{Demand/F.O.C.} & \Rightarrow & E=\omega^{E}KE\left(\frac{P^{KE}}{p^{E}}\right)^{\eta}\\
\\
\text{CES Price} & \Rightarrow & P^{KE}=\left[\left(1-\omega^{E}\right)\left(p^{K}\right)^{1-\eta}+\omega^{E}\left(p^{E}\right)^{1-\eta}\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\eta}}
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In these equations the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{j}$
\end_inset

 are share parameters.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is the elasticity of substitution between the two inputs.
 The input prices 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{j}$
\end_inset

(not the CES prices 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

) are user costs except for intermediate goods where it is a CES aggregate
 of spot prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One detail to mention is that, although we show it explicitly here, the
 production function is never used in the numerical solution to the problem.
 Much like the utility function in the household problem, only its derivatives
 are ever needed, and they enter the problem through the demand functions
 shown above.
 The problem is solved using only the demand functions and the constraint
 in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{KE}KE=p^{K}K+p^{E}E$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving all the problems in the tree requires knowing the correct prices
 of every input.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intermediate inputs and energy in production as well as capital investments
 are sourced from many production sectors, both domestic and foreign, in
 exactly the same way as all other demand components.
 The prices of intermediate inputs and investments are derived in input/output
 chapter.
 Firms pay same the wage pr.
 unit of labor, but user costs will generally differ between sectors due
 to differences in labor adjustment costs etc.
 The user cost of labor is derived in the labor market chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finding the correct input prices of capital (and labor) requires solving
 a dynamic, forward-looking, optimization problem.
 We look at the user cost of capital in the next subsection.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section derives the user cost of capital.
 All variables and parameters in the problem generally have a sub-index
 
\begin_inset Formula $(k,s,t)$
\end_inset

 – that is over investment/capital type, sector and time.
 In this section, this index will be truncated to only 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, unless otherwise explicitly stated.
 Given eight different private sectors and two types of capital, MAKRO has
 16 appropriately indexed versions of the variables and equations described.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
K_{t}=\left(1-\delta_{t}\right)K_{t-1}+I_{t}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the depreciation rate and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the investment flow.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Inventory investment is assumed to be proportional to net output: 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{invt,sp,t}=\mu_{sp,t}^{Invt}Y_{sp,t}$
\end_inset

.
 It does not accumulate or contribute to production.
 It is just a drain on resources in order to match the model with national
 accounts data, where it is small fraction of total spending (less than
 0.5 percent).
 Inventories are listed in the index 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 which identifies the three types of investments (inventories, equipment,
 structures): 
\begin_inset Formula $i=\{iL,iM,iB\}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Capital stocks are subject to adjustment costs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
AC_{t}=\frac{\gamma}{2}\left[\frac{K_{t}}{K_{t-1}}/\frac{K_{t-1}}{\overline{K}_{t-2}}-1\right]^{2}K_{t-1}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 parameter controls the severity of adjustment costs and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{K}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the average capital stock in the sector.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We apply the same adjustment cost function to prices, wages, and capital
 stocks.
 In each case, we consider the object with two lags to be external to the
 optimizing agent.
 I.e.
 we do not take a derivative wrt.
 the effect two periods ahead.
 Internalizing this tertiary effect has made no practical difference in
 testing.

\begin_layout Standard
Capital stocks are fixed in the short run due to one period time to build,
 but they can be used with varying intensity 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The problem of optimal capital utilization is examined below.
 Adjustment and utilization costs as well as vacancy costs are not explicitly
 measured in the data, and are modeled as unobserved lost production.
 Adjustment costs are subtracted from gross production, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 Gross and net output are related by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{t}=A_{s,t}\left[KELBR_{t}-\sum_{k}AC{}_{k,t}\right]
\]

\end_inset

where the index 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 identifies the type of capital good (equipment or structures).
 Note that we do not see the vacancy posting costs or labor utilization
 costs explicitly here, as they are modeled directly inside gross output
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and detailed in the labor market chapter.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{s,t}$
\end_inset

 measures residual total factor productivity after labor-saving technological
 progress (embodied in the quantity of labor supplied by households), variable
 factor utilization, and adjustment costs in labor and capital.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Debt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We model the debt issued by the firm as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D_{t}=\mu_{t}^{D}p_{t}^{I}K_{t}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{t}^{D}$
\end_inset

 is a factor taken as given by the optimizing firm and which can be viewed
 as the result of an independent optimal corporate capital structure problem.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{t}^{D}$
\end_inset

 is then an expression of a modified Modigliani-Miller theorem.
 There is an implicit trade-off between bankruptcy risk and associated costs
 on one hand, and the gain from financing the firm at a lower rate on the
 other.
 Currently all firms in the model have the same constant debt factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{t}^{D}=0.4$
\end_inset

.
 This way of modeling debt mirrors the way mortgage debt is modeled on our
 household side of the model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are other reasons to link debt to the firm's capital stock.
 One significant component of firm debt is mortgage debt, which is closely
 related to (or collateralized by) the firm's capital stock.
 Corporate debt is also issued with various covenants (such as not allowing
 sales of installed capital), which serve as an indirect claim on the firm's
 equipment and structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The problem of the firm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For exposition purposes, we state the problem with a single capital stock
 rather than two, and we use only the time index on all variables.
 As we focus only on the optimal choice of capital, we also leave out many
 details of the labor input.
 The operating surplus 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

The first block of the surplus expression in curved brackets lists elements
 affected by corporate taxes 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{t}^{c}$

 It contains net output, minus expenses on intermediate goods and on labor
 costs.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{t}^{K}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{t}^{L}$
\end_inset

 are net input taxes (such as property taxes, vehicle taxes, or payroll
 subsidies).
 Finally there are lump sum taxes 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{t}$
\end_inset

 and interest payments on debt 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}^{D}$
\end_inset

, all of which reduce the taxable income (corporate tax) generated by the
 firm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After these we have the nominal investment cost 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}^{I}I_{t}$
\end_inset

, the value of the tax deduction from capital depreciation, revenues (expenses)
 from increases (reductions) in corporate debt, and finally, the Lagrange
 multiplier (Tobin's q) and its attached law of motion for capital (the
 standard one), and the Lagrange multiplier and its attached law of motion
 for tax (or book) value capital.
 The tax value of capital is the nominal object,

\end_inset

.
 The required rate of return, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

, is taken as given by the firm and may vary across sectors if investors
 demand different risk premia to hold equity in different sector.
 In subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The first-order conditions for energy,

\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}^{KE}\frac{\partial KE_{t}}{\partial E_{t}}=P_{t}^{E}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}\frac{\partial KELBR_{t}}{\partial R_{t}}=P_{t}^{R}$

 cost minimization problem.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Intuition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Factor utilization is added to the model to help generate pro-cyclical value
 added per worker.
 In order to counter diminishing returns across all factors of production
 due to capital rigidity, it is necessary to compensate with a mechanism
 that increases total factor productivity.
 The equations used are flexible adaptations of the following idea.
 Let the firm have gross output given by a function of the type 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{t}=Q\left(u_{t}X_{t}\right)$
\end_inset

 with a generic first-order condition for optimal choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{t}\frac{\partial Q_{t}}{\partial\left(u_{t}X_{t}\right)}u_{t}=P_{t}^{X}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}^{X}$
\end_inset

 is the user cost of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 Utilization is then associated with an auxiliary stock variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 which obeys the following law of motion 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}=\left(u_{t}-1\right)X_{t}+\lambda_{t}x_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{t}=\bar{u}_{t-1}^{1/\eta}/\beta_{t}$
\end_inset

, and where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{u}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is an externality term which in equilibrium equals 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 This law of motion has a steady state solution at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u=1$
\end_inset

.
 We replace the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{t}$
\end_inset

 with the choice of the stock 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and impose the limit condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}x_{t}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Imposing symmetric equilibrium on the externality term, and lagging the
 expression one period, the resulting dynamic first-order condition is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{t}=\left(\frac{P_{t}^{X}/u_{t}}{P_{t+1}^{X}/u_{t+1}}\right)^{\eta^{u}}=\left(\frac{P_{t}^{X}/u_{t}}{P_{t+1}^{X}/u_{t+1}}\right)^{\eta^{u}}\left(\frac{P_{t-1}^{X}/u_{t-1}}{P_{t}^{X}/u_{t}}\right)^{-\eta^{u}}u_{t-1}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Labor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although we do not look at the optimal choice of labor in this chapter it
 is convenient to discuss its utilization rate here.
 Labor utilization is closer to the idea of effort.
 The object 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 contains many components and we use the term 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{L}$
\end_inset

 which is the marginal product 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}\frac{\partial KELBR_{t}}{\partial L}$
\end_inset

.
 In the 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(u\cdot X)$
\end_inset

 model above the object 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 equals 
\begin_inset Formula $L/u$
\end_inset

, with the resulting first-order condition
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{t}^{L}\frac{\partial L_{t}}{\partial u_{t}}\frac{\partial u_{t}}{\partial x_{t}}+\beta P_{t+1}^{L}\frac{\partial L_{t+1}}{\partial u_{t+1}}\frac{\partial u_{t+1}}{\partial x_{t}}=0
\]

\end_inset

and using the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial L_{t}/\partial u_{t}=L/u$
\end_inset

 we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{t}=\left(\frac{P_{t}^{L}}{P_{t+1}^{L}}\right)^{\eta}=\left(\frac{P_{t}^{L}}{P_{t+1}^{L}}\right)^{\eta}\left(\frac{P_{t}^{L}}{P_{t+1}^{L}}\right)^{-\eta}u_{t-1}

Firm investments with costly external finance
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Costly External Finance"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following we detail a reduced form way of modeling costly external
 finance through the firm's discount factor.
 Besides financial frictions being a realistic feature of the theory of
 the firm, they help generate pro-cyclical investment in line with data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
An illustrative example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest model of the firm abstracts from costly external finance.
 The firm has free access to funds at an exogenous rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{t}$
\end_inset

, which is the discount rate of its cash flows, and which is the required
 rate of return demanded by all investors.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are also no conflicts of interest between management and ownership,
 and no issues of corporate control.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A simple illustration of this model is the one variable example where the
 capital stock obeys the standard law of motion 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{t}=\left(1-\delta\right)K_{t-1}+I_{t}$
\end_inset

, and profits are given by revenues minus investment costs, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{t}=Y\left(K_{t-1}\right)-P_{t}^{I}I_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The unconstrained optimal choice of capital obeys
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\pi_{t}}{\partial K_{t}}+\beta_{t+1}\frac{\partial\pi_{t+1}}{\partial K_{t}}=0
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{t+1}=1/(1+r_{t+1})$
\end_inset

 is the discount factor which is exogenous to the firm and is not affected
 by how much the firm chooses to invest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this is an incomplete model since financing the firm's activity
 is a complex process.
 When firms finance their activity, the immediate source of funds is retained
 earnings or internal finance.
 This is often not enough and firms also interact with banks, issue corporate
 debt, and raise or buy back equity.
 One common characteristic of all sources of outside finance is that it
 is costly and therefore, we want to extend the model of the firm by defining
 this cost.
 Before that, in order for costly external finance to matter the firm must
 be in need of funds: it must be constrained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest model of costly outside finance adds a constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{t}\geq\bar{\pi}$
\end_inset

.
 Outside finance beyond this threshold is infinitely costly.
 With a Lagrange multiplier 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 the optimal decision obeys
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\pi_{t}}{\partial K_{t}}+\left[\beta_{t+1}\frac{1+\xi_{t+1}}{1+\xi_{t}}\right]\frac{\partial\pi_{t+1}}{\partial K_{t}}=0
\]

\end_inset

where if 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{t}<\bar{\pi}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{t}>0$
\end_inset

 (and large enough).
 The firm can raise cash freely up until the threshold and after that the
 cost of outside finance is prohibitive.
 The optimality condition shows that this financial friction is fully captured
 in the generalized discount factor.

\shape italic
 
\shape default
While this is not a general property of models of firm finance, we choose
 our model so that we have it.
 When the constraint binds, this generalized discount factor is lower (the
 future becomes less relevant).
 This is intuitive as the effect of costly external finance is to reduce
 investment.
 However, that is not the only effect of costly external finance on the
 firm.
 In fact, how this constraint moves is more interesting over the business
 cycle.
 Although the existence of costly external finance acts to 
\emph on
reduce
\emph default
 investment, as long as the constraint is normally binding what matters
 is how the constraint tightens and relaxes.
 These effects through the constraint help propagate the business cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In MAKRO we model the costs of external finance assuming that they generally
 bind.
 We do this by using a differentiable cost function as in Gomes (2001) as
 a flexible way of modeling the above Lagrange multiplier.
 His model is as follows.
 Dividends are
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{t}=\pi_{t}-\xi\left(m_{t}\right)
\]

\end_inset

with the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 having value zero for 
\begin_inset Formula $m\leq0$
\end_inset

 and a positive increasing function for 
\begin_inset Formula $m>0$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{t}=-\pi_{t}=P_{t}^{I}I_{t}-Y_{t}$
\end_inset

, and it is easy to verify that it yields the same first-order condition
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\pi_{t}}{\partial K_{t}}+\left[\beta_{t+1}\frac{1+\frac{\partial\xi_{t+1}}{\partial m_{t+1}}}{1+\frac{\partial\xi_{t}}{\partial m_{t}}}\right]\frac{\partial\pi_{t+1}}{\partial K_{t}}=0
\]

 cost function.

\begin_layout Standard
The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{s,t}$
\end_inset

 is sector specific with sector subscript 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, and is approximately homogeneous if 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{m}_{s,t}=0$
\end_inset

 and with high enough 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

.
 To preserve long run homogeneity with a free cash flow target different
 from zero we let 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{m}_{s,t}$
\end_inset

 endogenously adjust as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\overline{m}_{s,t}=\gamma\overline{m}_{s,t-1}+\left(1-\gamma\right)m_{s,t}-\epsilon_{s,t}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 controls the speed of adjustment and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{s,t}$
\end_inset

 is calibrated to set 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{m}_{s,t}=m_{s,t}$
\end_inset

 in the baseline forecast.
 We calibrate 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{s,t}=\frac{\hat{\kappa}}{K_{s,t}}$
\end_inset

 (other measures of sector size can be used) to ensure similar behavior
 across sectors.
 For strict homogeneity 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{s,t}$
\end_inset

 would need to endogenously adapt to changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{s,t}$
\end_inset

, but this is unlikely to matter in practice as 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{s,t}-\overline{m}_{s,t}$
\end_inset

 converges to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to define the 'habit adjusted' free cash flow 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{m}_{s,t}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{m}_{s,t}\equiv m_{s,t}-\overline{m}_{s,t}=\gamma\left[m_{s,t}-m_{s,t-1}+\hat{m}_{s,t-1}\right]+\epsilon_{s,t}

Rearranging the augmented discount factor we get an expression for the discount
 rate premium associated with the financial constraint

Acceleration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The financial constraint model we use is closer to the Gomes (2001) model
 than to collateral acceleration models such as Bernanke and Gertler (1989).
 The factors relaxing the constraint in good times come from the expansion
 of revenues as prices increase and from the increased production ability
 as capital accumulates.
 There is no additional contribution from an improvement in collateral values
 or from any additional relaxation of the constraint from a goodwill effect
 arising from extra revenues.

Production firms hold and manage liquid assets (cash, credit lines, liquid
 assets) since, due to financial frictions, cash inside the firm is not
 identical to cash outside it.
 These frictions are currently modeled parsimoniously in the production
 model and so the presence of financial assets in the firm's balance sheet
 is dealt with in reduced form and separated from the firm's optimization
 problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Financial services also account for a significant share of total services.
 We do not have a model of the financial firm, and therefore there is no
 theory of endogenous optimal decision making for these agents, but we do
 have basic principles of financial arbitrage which we apply to include
 financial stocks and flows in the MAKRO model.
 These assets must be adequately accounted for in order to fit the national
 accounts data (Nationalregnskabet) and make up a separate entity from productio

The value of cash and other low-return instruments outside the firm would
 be higher than the discounted nominal value of their returns inside the
 firm.
 This is corrected by their convenience yield: this is the exact difference
 between the nominal yield the asset generates and the required rate on
 equity.
 Keynes used the idea of convenience yield in his money demand function.

Valuation algebra

\begin_layout Standard
We divide the value of the firm, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{t}$
\end_inset

, into two separate objects: 1) The value of the main operations of the
 firm 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{x}$
\end_inset

, and 2) the value of net financial assets not related to the main operations,
 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{t}^{x}$

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

V_{t}=V_{t}^{x}+B_{t}^{x}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The value of operations is the discounted value of the cash flows that result
 from the endogenous optimal decisions of the firm:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{t}^{x}=\frac{\pi_{t+1}+V_{t+1}^{x}}{1+r_{t+1}^{E}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The required return on equity is the sum of the bond rate and an equity
 risk premium and differs from the discount rate used by the firm in its
 optimal production decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Net financial assets consist of a several asset classes (index 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) and two types of debt (index 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 for liabilities).
 All the portfolio components are valued at their market price.
 For example, financial firms hold a large number of mortgage bonds that
 we value at their market price rather than discounting their associated
 interest rate payments with the required return on equity.
 The debt associated with capital, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{t}^{D}P_{t}^{I}K_{t}$
\end_inset

, is included in the value of main operations and is therefore not included
 in net financial assets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{t}^{x}=\underbrace{\sum_{A}B_{A,t}}_{\text{financial assets}}-\left[\underbrace{\sum_{L}B_{L,t}}_{\text{total debt}}-\underbrace{\mu_{t}^{D}P_{t}^{I}K_{t}}_{\text{debt from operations}}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume that the firm holds financial assets proportional to the value
 of their main operations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
We can now write a budget constraint of the firm which ties together net
 financial assets with the cash flow from main operations, dividends paid
 and finally revenue from new equity issues (buybacks if negative):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
B_{t}^{x}=\left(1+\left[1-\tau_{t}^{c}\right]r_{t}^{Bx}\right)B_{t-1}^{x}+\pi_{t}-div_{t}+issues_{t}+\underbrace{\epsilon_{t}}_{\text{other transfers}}

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

Note that the rate of return on equity 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(r^{div}+r^{omv}\right)$
\end_inset

 is unaffected by the dividend policy and equity issuance.
 I.e., if the firm issues equities and uses the money to buy financial assets,
 the value of shares including financial assets, 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{t}$

 Similarly, when the firm pays dividends, their value decreases by the same
 amount.

Financial accounting terms and corporate taxes

In order to define the scope of corporate taxation 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{t}^{c}$
\end_inset

 we make a detour to discuss how EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests, Taxes,
 Depreciation and Amortization) , and how EBT (Earnings Before Tax), translate
 into the income the cash flow from main operations, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

, (which we used in the dynamic optimization problem of the firm):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The extraction sector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extractions sector consists of oil and gas and a small amount of gravel
 extraction.
 Output and prices from this sector are exogenous and based on forecasts
 from the Danish Energy Agency (Energistyrelsen).
 Given the exogenous output, production factors are endogenously chosen
 to minimize costs and modeled the same way as other sectors apart from
 the existence of an additional tax:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau_{\text{extraction},t}^{c}=\tau_{t}^{c}+\frac{y_{\text{extraction,}t}-y_{t}^{\text{\emph{gravel}}}}{y_{\text{extraction,}t}}\tau_{t}^{oil}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As both the price and domestic output quantity is exogenous, we scale the
 demand for domestic extraction output proportionally to match the supply.
 Demand for extraction imports is scaled inversely such that the total demand
 for extraction does not depend on the exogenized sector output.
 I.e., import and domestic production of extraction are perfect substitutes,
 and we allocate a share of domestic output to different types of demand
 and use imports to satisfy residual demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The housing sector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the national accounts, the housing sector produces housing services where
 the key input is a measure of the stock of houses.
 The sector includes both rental and privately owned housing and produces
 a homogeneous good priced at the rental value of housing.
 The rent value of owner-occupied housing is imputed based on rents of comparabl
e rental housing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model, we have an endogenous decision by households on owner-occupied
 housing while rental housing enters the household problem exogenously.
 As we do not (yet) model the rental market, both consumption and production
 of rental housing are exogenous.
 The housing stock available for rent is exogenous and assumed to depend
 on government-supported rental building projects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the rental part of housing is exogenous, we need to decouple
 it from owner-occupied housing.
 In order to achieve this separation, we model the production of housing
 services using a Leontief production function.
 The main input is the existing stock of housing (structures) and there
 is no input of capital equipment.
 Note that this measure of housing stock excludes land, and therefore it
 is not the housing measure, 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, described in the household chapter.
 In the data, this sector accounts for services such as housing maintenance
 
\begin_inset Formula $(\approx15\%)$
\end_inset

, which involves labor and intermediate inputs, and other (mainly financial)
 services 
\begin_inset Formula $(\approx10\%)$
\end_inset

, and for that reason it is organized as a production sector within the
 input/output structure of the economy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These three inputs, structures, labor, and intermediate goods, generate
 output through a Leontief production function.
 The consequence is that output, employment, and intermediate goods are
 proportional to the capital stock measure.
 Unlike production in the other private sectors, there are no adjustment
 costs to capital, and therefore, net and gross production are the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since everything is proportional to capital, we can separate all inputs
 and output in proportion to the fraction of structures that are owner-occupied
 housing (described as “bricks” in the household chapter) and the fraction
 which is rental housing.
 This is equivalent to assuming separate but identical Leontief production
 technologies for owner-occupied and rental housing, so they have equal
 amounts of intermediate goods and labor in proportion to their respective
 building capital stock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the rental part of the data is separated, we calculate how it behaves
 in existing data and forecast its use of resources in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Formalizing the problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Net output 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}$

 uses energy 
\begin_inset Formula $(E)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $(L)$
\end_inset

, structures 
\begin_inset Formula $(K_{iB})$
\end_inset

, and intermediate goods 
\begin_inset Formula $(R)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{t}=A_{t}\cdot KELBR_{t}\left(E_{t},L_{t},K_{iB,t-1},R_{t}\right)=A_{t}\cdot\min\left(\frac{\phi_{iB}}{\phi_{R}}R_{t},\min\left(\phi_{iB}K_{iB,t-1},\min\left(\frac{\phi_{iB}}{\phi_{L}}L_{t},\frac{\phi_{iB}}{\phi_{L}}E_{t}\right)\right)\right)
\]

\end_inset

and the Leontief function implies the optimality conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $KELBR_{t}=\phi_{iB}K_{iB,t-1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{t}=\phi_{E}K_{iB,t-1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $L_{t}=\phi_{L}K_{iB,t-1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{t}=\phi_{R}K_{iB,t-1}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The capital stock 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{iB,t}$
\end_inset

 (here, the total stock of structures or “bricks”), and the associated investmen
ts, are the sum of owner-occupied and rental housing.
 The owner-occupied housing part is endogenous, while the rental part is
 an exogenous projection.
 The owned housing part of this stock is described in the household chapter
 in the section covering the housing intermediary.
 Output, employment, and the use of intermediate inputs are endogenous,
 but all of them are proportional to the stock due to the Leontief production
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Link to the household problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we decouple rental housing from owned housing, we introduce them differently
 in the household problem.
 The rental housing coming out of this sector is added exogenously to the
 household's budget constraint, while owner-occupied housing is an optimal
 decision.
 Owner-occupied housing is bought from an intermediary that takes a flow
 product from the construction sector, puts it on a plot of land, and sells
 the final combined good (bricks and land) to the household.
 Rental housing does not explicitly contain land.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Land is introduced in MAKRO in this specific way to improve house prices'
 modeling.
 The user cost of owner-occupied housing includes the effect of the price
 of land.
 Currently, land is not included in any other product or sector.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 If we remove the value added of land from the house bought by households,
 we have a stock equivalent to the rental housing capital, and the sum of
 the two stocks match the data from the housing services sector described
 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the problem of the household we can find in the budget constraint a term
 which accounts for expenses with housing maintenance, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}P_{t-1}^{D}D_{a-1,t-1}$
\end_inset

.
 The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 in this term is taken as given by the household and is the fraction of
 the energy, labor and intermediate goods costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[P_{t}^{E}\phi_{E}+P_{t}^{L}\phi_{L}+P_{t}^{R}\phi_{R}\right]$
\end_inset

 we have in the problem above which is allocated to owner-occupied housing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the household owns the stock of owner-occupied housing and pays
 directly for its maintenance costs.
 Therefore only the fraction of sector profits corresponding to rental housing
 can be allocated through the ownership of the firm in the household portfolio,
 controlling for the fact that households consume an exogenous amount of
 rental housing and pay rent on it.
