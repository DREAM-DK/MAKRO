\begin_layout Section
Labor market
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The labor market contains heterogeneous households (unconstrained and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Hand-to-Mouth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 type of households age 15 to 100) and firms.
 Households choose the amount of working hours and their labor market participat
ion.
 Labor demand comes from firms posting their optimal amount of job vacancies,
 and a matching function brings vacancies and workers together.
 The model closes with bargaining between agents representing workers and
 firms, setting the market wage.
 The model aims to reproduce the level and behavior of Danish employment
 and wages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A difficulty when formulating the labor market is that there is heterogeneity
 on both the supply and demand side - a life cycle with workers of different
 ages and multiple sectors on the firm side.
 We therefore build the model so that the household side is age-specific
 and the firm side is sector-specific, but the two dimensions are never
 present simultaneously.
 In addition, there are two types of households, the constrained/impatient
 and the unconstrained/patient, and we solve the model so that both types
 have the same labor market decisions.
 The following are the key assumptions we make:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firms cannot choose who they hire.
 Firms and workers meet randomly in the matching process, and once the meeting
 takes place, it is never optimal to send the worker away, irrespective
 of how old the worker might be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Optimal labor market participation and hours are age-specific but not sector
 specific.
 The worker cannot choose which sector she will be employed in and cannot
 voluntarily quit a job in one sector to join a different one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For computational reasons, we do not solve for the age distribution of workers
 inside each firm and instead impose that it is always the same for every
 firm.
 The data shows that the average age of workers is the same across firms
 of different sizes and for firms that are expanding or shrinking in terms
 of labor force size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it is not the purpose of the model to unconditionally forecast
 long run trends in labor market participation or hours worked.
 Rather, these are exogenous inputs to the model's baseline based on detailed
 demographic projections including education, gender, and immigration status
 (Befolkningsregnskab).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Household problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an exogenous number, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a,t}$
\end_inset

, of households of age 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 In this chapter, we interpret each household as containing a unit mass
 of agents who share the unemployment risk.
 We suppress the index within cohort heterogeneity, 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, as we let labor supply be identical for all households of a given age.
 Households aged 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 survive into the following age and period with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 When a household dies its entire unit mass of members dies with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q_{a,t}^{e}<1$
\end_inset

 be the fraction of the household unit mass of workers employed in period
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 At the start of each period, agents in a household of age 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 can be in one of two labor market states: those who have kept their jobs
 from the previous period, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-\delta_{a,t}\right)q_{a-1,t-1}^{e}$
\end_inset

, and the remaining 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\left(1-\delta_{a-1,t-1}\right)q_{a-1,t-1}^{e}$
\end_inset

 that start the period without a job.
 The object 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is an exogenous age-specific job destruction rate.
 After decisions are taken in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and the market clears 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a,t}^{e}$
\end_inset

 are employed.
 From the household point of view employment evolves according to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{a,t}^{e}=\left(1-\delta_{a,t}\right)q_{a-1,t-1}^{e}+x_{t}q_{a,t}^{s}\label{eq:LOM_emp}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a,t}^{s}$
\end_inset

 is search effort and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the job finding probability.
 We now define a measure of labor force participation
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We calibrate this measure to be identical to the concept of the 
\emph on
gross labor force
\emph default
 (brutto-arbejdsstyrke) in aggregate, but not by age.,
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as the sum of the employed and the unsuccessful search effort:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
q_{a,t}^{lf}\equiv q_{a,t}^{e}+(1-x_{t})q_{a,t}^{s}\label{eq:qlf}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Total employment, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}=n_{t}^{e}+n_{t}^{f}$
\end_inset

 , contains the employment of residents, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}^{e}=\sum_{a}q_{a,t}^{e}N_{a,t}$
\end_inset

, plus a number of workers that are not residents, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t}^{f}$
\end_inset

 (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Non-resident"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Household problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
We extend household utility to include disutility from hours worked, 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{a,t}^{e}$
\end_inset

, and from labor market participation, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a,t}^{lf}$
\end_inset

.
 We have then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{a,t}(C_{a,t},D_{a,t})-\underbrace{Z_{a,t}^{h}}_{\text{Control}}\underbrace{\rho_{a,t}^{e}q_{a,t}^{e}}_{\text{Scaling}}\underbrace{\frac{\left(\lambda_{a,t}^{h}\right)^{\eta^{h}}}{1+\eta^{h}}\left(h_{a,t}^{e}\right)^{1+\eta^{h}}}_{\text{Hours}}+\underbrace{Z_{a,t}^{lf}}_{\text{Control}}\underbrace{\frac{\left(\lambda_{a,t}^{lf}\right)^{\eta^{lf}}}{1-\eta^{lf}}\left(1-q_{a,t}^{lf}\right)^{1-\eta^{lf}}}_{\text{Participation}}
\]

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 controls are exogenous to the household and used to control for stationarity,
 and, in line with Galí, Smets, and Wouters (2012), to eliminate the marginal
 utility of consumption from the first order conditions.
 This allows us to have the same search and hours decisions for HtM and
 unconstrained households, which greatly reduces model complexity.
 The objects 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{a,t}^{lf}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{a,t}^{h}$
\end_inset

 are calibration parameters.
 As hours vary by age in the data the disutility parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{a,t}^{h}$
\end_inset

 varies with age to match this pattern.
 Note that the CRRA disutility of labor market participation binds labor
 market participation 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a,t}^{lf}$
\end_inset

 below one for all age groups; and as the probability of finding a job is
 also in the unit interval, so is employment 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a,t}^{e}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Utility maximization is subject to the 
\emph on
budget constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\Pi_{a,t} & =\underbrace{\left(1-\tau_{a,t}\right)w_{t}\rho_{a,t}^{e}h_{a,t}^{e}}_{\text{yearly wages after taxes}}\underbrace{q_{a,t}^{e}}_{\text{employment}}\label{B.C.}\\
 & +\left(1-\tau_{a,t}\right)b_{a,t}\underbrace{\left(q_{a,t}^{lf}-q_{a,t}^{e}\right)}_{\text{unemployment}}\\
 & +\left(1-\tau_{a,t}\right)b_{a,t}\underbrace{\left(1-q_{a,t}^{lf}\right)}_{\text{out of the labor force}}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The household's after-tax wage depends on their effective tax rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{a,t}$
\end_inset

, the market wage 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

, age specific productivity 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{a,t}^{e}$
\end_inset

 and finally the number of hours worked 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{a,t}^{e}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 is the unemployment compensation received by those that are unemployed
 or out of the labor force, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 summarizes all other budget constraint terms which do not appear in the
 problem at hand.
 As we do not make compensation contingent on search, the budget constraint
 simplifies to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{a,t}=b_{a,t}+\left[\left(1-\tau_{a,t}\right)w_{t}\rho_{a,t}^{e}h_{a,t}^{e}-b_{a,t}\right]q_{a,t}^{e}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which says that every household member earns 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{a,t}$
\end_inset

, and working members earn an additional wage premium 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1-\tau_{a,t}\right)\left[w_{t}\rho_{a,t}^{e}h_{a,t}^{e}-b_{a,t}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 As the tax rate depends on the household's labor market participation and
 their number of hours worked, we write the wage premium more generally
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial\Pi_{a,t}}{\partial q_{a,t}^{e}}$
\end_inset

.
 From this wage premium we define 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{a,t}^{b}$
\end_inset

 as the net benefit replacement rate of a household on the extensive margin
 of the labor market, i.e.
 the income after taxes and subsidies received by a household that is not
 employed, divided by the income received by that household if they found
 a job.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-r_{a,t}^{b}\equiv\frac{\partial\Pi_{a,t}/\partial q_{a,t}^{e}}{\left(1-\tau_{a,t}\right)w_{t}\rho_{a,t}^{e}h_{a,t}^{e}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This rate determines the incentive to search for a job and participate in
 the labor market.
 The net replacement rate 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{a,t}^{b}$
\end_inset

 is exogenous to the model and based on calculations from the Ministry of
 Finance's models of rules and administrative data (Lovmodeller).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effective tax rate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{a,t}$
\end_inset

, is likewise a complicated function of income and deductions, but crucially
 depends on the number of hours worked by the household.
 Rather than specifying this function here, we define the marginal income
 tax rate directly as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-\tau_{a,t}^{m}\equiv\frac{\partial\Pi_{a,t}/\partial h_{a,t}^{e}}{w_{t}\rho_{a,t}^{e}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The level of age specific marginal tax rates 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{a,t}^{m}$
\end_inset

 are also based on Ministry of Finance calculations, but move endogenously
 with shocks to tax rates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are now ready to maximize utility subject to the budget constraint and
 obtain the first-order conditions for participation and hours.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Optimal choice of hours
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first order condition for household 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{a,t}^{e}$
\end_inset

 is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[1-\tau_{a,t}^{m}\right]U_{a,t}^{c}\frac{w_{t}\rho_{a,t}^{e}}{p_{t}^{c}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
U_{a,t}^{c}\left[1-\tau_{a,t}^{m}\right]\frac{w_{t}}{p_{t}^{c}}=Z_{a,t}^{h}\left(\lambda_{a,t}^{h}h_{a,t}^{e}\right)^{\eta^{h}}\label{eq:hours_optimality}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{a,t}^{h}=Z_{a,t}^{c}Z_{a,t}^{\tau}Z_{t}^{w}$
\end_inset

.
 The term 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{t}^{w}$
\end_inset

 is used to control the impact of after-tax real wages.
 The term 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{a,t}^{c}$
\end_inset

 is used to eliminate the wealth effect from this equation.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The standard is to assume 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{a,t}^{c}$
\end_inset

 is a function of average marginal utility which in symmetric equilibrium
 equals the individual marginal utility.
 With the pooling assumptions within the unit mass of each household, and
 the assumption that all households are identical the average and the marginal
 are always identical but the symmetric equilibrium concept remains.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We let the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 terms be defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{t}^{w}=\frac{w_{t}}{p_{t}^{c}}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{c}
Z_{a,t}^{c}=U_{a,t}^{c}\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

Eliminating the impact of real wages and marginal utility of consumption,
 the only remaining endogenous channel is from the marginal income tax rate
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{a,t}^{m}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
h_{a,t}^{e}=\frac{1}{\lambda_{a,t}^{h}}\left[\frac{1-\tau_{a,t}^{m}}{Z_{a,t}^{\tau}}\right]^{\frac{1}{\eta^{h}}}\label{eq:hours_reduced}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, this effect is also eliminated by setting 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{a,t}^{\tau}=\left[1-\tau_{a,t}^{m}\right]$
\end_inset

, however model users can enable endogenous effects of shocks to marginal
 taxes on hours worked by exogenizing 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{a,t}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We do not model the long run downward trend of the workweek.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{t}^{c}$
\end_inset

 rules out the income effect (higher consumption implying lower marginal
 utility) and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{a,t}^{\tau}$
\end_inset

 rules out the substitution effect of higher taxes (funding the expanding
 welfare state) in the baseline.
 An trend in preferences 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{a,t}^{h}$
\end_inset

 can be used to match an exogenously imposed trend in the baseline.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In that case, the elasticity of hours worked to the marginal tax rate is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial\ln h_{a,t}^{e}}{\partial\tau_{a,t}}=-\frac{1}{\eta^{h}\left[1-\tau_{a,t}^{m}\right]}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

Optimality trades off current against future marginal utility, where

\begin_layout Standard
In our model, total employment includes employed residents in Denmark and
 non-resident workers.
 Above, we outlined the decisions made by resident households.
 However, we assume that firms do not distinguish between residents and
 non-residents when they hire.
 Non-residents workers are cross-border agents that work in Denmark, but
 live abroad most or all of the year.
 These non-resident workers are not part of the resident population 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 and they do not have any direct consumption in Denmark.
 Non-resident workers provide search input, 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}^{s,f}$
\end_inset

, into the matching function and generate employment 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,t}^{f}$
\end_inset

.
 They face the same job destruction rates and die and migrate at the same
 rate as the locals, and they stay in their jobs when they are not destroyed
 but do not demand local consumption or housing.
 However, in order to match the data, they have different productivity and
 work different hours than resident workers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-resident workers have the same probability of finding a job as local
 job searchers, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n_{t}^{f}=\left(1-\delta_{t}\right)n_{t-1}^{f}+x_{t}n_{t}^{s,f}
\]

\end_inset

The total number of cross-border persons who are either employed or searching
 for a job in Denmark can be written as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N_{t}^{f}=\left(1-\delta_{t}\right)n_{t-1}^{f}+n_{t}^{s,f}
\]

\end_inset

We assume that this total is exogenous.
 The number of non-resident workers searching for a job is then endogenous
 and given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n_{t}^{s,f}=N_{t}^{f}-\left(1-\delta_{t}\right)n_{t-1}^{f}

E.g.
 when the job-finding rate is higher, more potential migrant workers find
 employment, reducing the search input of non-resident workers in the following

The problem of the firm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firms maximize profits and choose an optimal amount of labor input.
 When firms post vacancies, they hire workers.
 Although workers are “attached” to hours and productivity, the choice variable
 for the firm is 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 as the firm takes 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 as given.
 Current profits (as relevant for the optimal employment decision) are given
 by

\begin_inset Formula $Y_{s}$

\begin_inset Formula $p_{s,t}^{0}$

 Wages paid by firms pr.

\begin_inset Formula $n_{s,t}$

 is the

 Below we will derive the user cost of labor, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{s,t}^{L}\equiv p_{s,t}^{0}\partial Q_{s}/\partial L_{t}$
\end_inset

 which is evaluated at firm optimization price 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{0}$
\end_inset

 This optimization price is derived in the production chapter.
 The production input 
\begin_inset Formula $L$

\begin_layout Standard
Note that sector specific hours and productivity disappear.
 This is consistent with the assumption that firms pay the same wage pr.
 productive hour of labor, i.e.
 the sector differences only reflect that the average worker in each sector
 provides a different number of productive hours of labor.
 Shifts in the sector-composition of employment therefore do not affect
 the total productivity units of labor available and does not directly affect
 total wages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Link to CES optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dynamic first-order condition provides the input to the CES minimization
 problem used in solving the overall problem of the firm.
 The CES function is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{s,t}^{KL}Q_{s,t}^{KL}\equiv p_{s,t}^{KL}\left[\left(\mu_{s,t}^{k}\right)^{\frac{1}{E}}\left(u_{s,t}^{k}K_{s,t}\right)^{\frac{E-1}{E}}+\left(\mu_{s,t}^{l}\right)^{\frac{1}{E}}\left(L_{s,t}\right)^{\frac{E-1}{E}}\right]^{\frac{E}{E-1}}
\]

\end_inset

On the budget side of the CES problem we have the total cost associated
 with all the labor actually used, 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{s,t}^{KL}Q_{s,t}^{KL}\equiv p_{s,t}^{L}L_{s,t}+p_{s,t}^{K}K_{s,t}
\]

\end_inset

where the object 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{s,t}^{L}$
\end_inset

 is the user cost of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 In the CES optimization problem we take a derivative with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{j,t}$
\end_inset

 and this yields
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L_{s,t}=\mu_{s,t}^{l}Q_{s,t}^{KL}\left(\frac{p_{s,t}^{L}}{p_{s,t}^{KL}}\right)^{-E}
\]

\end_inset

The last identity ensures the CES problem is consistent with the optimization
 problem and shows the relationship between the user cost of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and the optimal choice of vacancies.
 The accompanying expression for capital is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u_{t}^{k}K_{s,t}=\mu_{s,t}^{k}Q_{s,t}^{KL}\left(\frac{p_{s,t}^{K}}{p_{s,t}^{KL}}\frac{1}{u_{t}^{k}}\right)^{-E}
\]

\end_inset

and it looks slightly different from the labor one but that is because utilizati
on is embodied in the 
\begin_inset Formula $L$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use the matching function from den Haan, Ramey & Watson (2000) which
 is defined in the following way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m\left(v_{t},n_{t}^{s}\right)=\frac{n_{t}^{s}}{\left[\left(v_{t}\right)^{1/\eta^{m}}+\left(n_{t}^{s}\right)^{1/\eta^{m}}\right]^{\eta^{m}}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total number of searchers is the aggregate of households by age as well
 as non-resident job-searchers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n_{t}^{s}=n_{t}^{s,f}+\sum_{a}q_{a,t}^{lf}N_{a,t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and total vacancies is the sum of vacancies posted by each sector:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v_{t}=\sum_{s}v_{s,t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The labor market equilibrium condition states that the number of job searchers
 finding a job must be equal to the number of vacancies filled and relates
 the vacancy matching rate 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 to the job finding rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{t}n_{t}^{s}=m_{t}v_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matching function specification has a few important properties.
 It has constant returns to scale and can be rewritten as a function of
 labor market tightness 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{v_{t}}{n_{t}^{s}}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m\left(\frac{v_{t}}{n_{t}^{s}}\right)=\left[\left(\frac{v_{t}}{n_{t}^{s}}\right)^{1/\eta^{m}}+1\right]^{-\eta^{m}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also bounded between zero and one.
 I.e.
 if there are no other vacancies, a firm that posts a vacancy is sure to
 fill it.
 However, if there are no job-searchers left the probability of filling
 a vacancy goes to zero.
 More importantly, the job finding rate 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is also bounded between zero and one.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The finding rate as a function of labor market tightness is 
\begin_inset Formula $x\left(\frac{v_{t}}{n_{t}^{s}}\right)=\left[\left(\frac{v_{t}}{n_{t}^{s}}\right)^{-1/\eta^{m}}+1\right]^{-\eta^{m}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 Combined with the condition that labor force participation 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a,t}^{lf}$
\end_inset

 is bounded, this ensures that both unemployment and employment rates are
 positive for all ages.
 Finally, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta^{m}$
\end_inset

 controls how sensitive households' and firms' probabilities of finding
 a job or filling a vacancy are to changes in labor market conditions.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta^{m}$
\end_inset

 is one of the key parameters that we set in order to match MAKRO's impulse
 responses to a number of empirical models.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ensures that a change in public employment has a proportional effect
 on the public sector payroll, before general equilibrium effects, and that
 changes in employment between private sectors has no direct effect on the
 public payroll.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\text{Pub},t}$
\end_inset

 has no effect on public production (see the chapter on public production),
 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\text{Pub},t}w_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the hourly wage paid by the government.
 Sector specific productivity is calibrated to match differences in hourly
 wages across sectors, and only reflect differences in productivity insofar
 as differences in wages in the data reflect differences in productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given public sector productivity, the productivity in each private sector
 is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho_{s,t}=\mu_{s,t}^{\rho}\cdot\frac{\sum_{s\ne\text{Pub}}\rho_{s,t}h_{s,t}n_{s,t}}{\sum_{s\ne\text{Pub}}\mu_{s}^{\rho}h_{s}n_{s}}\mid s\ne\text{Pub}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{s,t}^{\rho}$
\end_inset

 is a parameter which controls for differences in productivity (hourly wages)
 between private sectors.
 The interpretation is as follows: Differences in wages between sectors
 are entirely due to differences in productivity tied to the composition
 of workers in different sectors.
 Shifts in the sector-composition of employment therefore does not affect
 the total productivity units of labor available and does not directly affect
 total wages.

Employment law of motion, firm's point of view

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n_{t}=\left(1-\delta_{t}\right)n_{t-1}+m_{t}v_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we make the necessary assumption to ensure non-resident workers have
 the same law of motion as residents we can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1-\delta_{t}=\frac{\sum_{a}\left(1-\delta_{a,t}\right)n_{a-1,t-1}^{e}\frac{N_{a,t}}{N_{a-1,t-1}}}{\sum_{a}n_{a-1,t-1}^{e}}
\]

\end_inset

where the aggregate destruction rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 is now endogenous (although exogenous to the firm).
 Unlike the age-specific job destruction rate, the aggregate job destruction
 rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 includes job destruction due to migration or death - both effects are captured
 by the change in cohort size 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{N_{a,t}}{N_{a-1,t-1}}$
\end_inset

 (see Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the firm cannot choose whom it hires, it effectively always hires
 the average job searcher.
 Then, as we impose the same age distribution inside every firm irrespective
 of sector, all firms are the same in this respect and face the same job
 destruction rate.
 Since they do not control who they hire, they do not control the job destructio
n rate either (see Appendix

\begin_layout Subsection
Wage determination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have derived the equations determining optimal search/participation (labor
 supply) and optimal vacancy posting (labor demand), but in both cases taking
 the wage level as given.
 To determine the wage level, we use an adapted Nash bargaining problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We assume a unique bargaining agent on both sides of the market which aggregate,
 on one side, preferences of all firms from all sectors, and, on the other,
 preferences of all workers of all ages.
 We also assume that these agents, which we can call unions, are “distant”
 from their firm and worker constituents and solve a simplified problem
 on their behalf.
 These assumptions allow for a degree of freedom in setting up the surpluses
 that enter the bargaining problem.
 One other important assumption is that although we consider a single bargaining
 problem that includes all agents, the intervening unions disregard the
 impact of the wage on equilibrium employment.
 Finally, we model wage rigidity directly in the bargaining problem through
 an adjustment cost function that extends the usual Nash bargaining surplus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bargaining
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution to the bargaining problem results in a bargained wage 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Wage rigidity is introduced by adding a cost function to the standard Nash
 formulation.
 This cost function captures a utility loss of changing wages as perceived
 by the bargaining agents.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Ljungqvist and Sargent, (2017) discuss standard formulations of the bargaining
 problem.
 The cost function draws on Kravik & Mimir (2019) and we use it also in
 the price setting problem.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It also makes the problem dynamic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}$
\end_inset

 denote the surplus of the unions representing the workers and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{t}$
\end_inset

 that of the firms.
 These surpluses which enter the Nash bargaining function are given by the
 difference between the value of agreement and the value of disagreement
 for each party.
 Disagreement is an out of equilibrium event that never happens in model
 (we do not model labor disputes explicitly).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of the union representing workers the surplus is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S\left(w_{t}\right)=\underbrace{\left(1-\bar{\tau}_{t}\right)\rho_{t}h_{t}n_{t}}_{S_{t}^{\prime}}w_{t}-o_{t}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\tau}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the weighted average of the personal income tax rate

\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and 
\begin_inset Formula $o_{t}$
\end_inset

 is an outside option value which is exogenous to the agents
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We model the outside option as a constant share of the sum of wages, weighed
 by the job finding probability:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
o_{t}=\mu^{o}S_{t}^{\prime}x_{t}w_{t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The expression for the outside option can be interpreted as a share of the
 period and foregone wage 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\mu^{o}$
\end_inset

 wasted in negotiations, after which the job seeker can find a different
 job with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Without better empirical foundations we are not ready to directly link
 unemployment compensation to the wage bargaining process, and we allow
 for the idea that searching for a different job is also an important outside
 option in decentralized negotiations.
 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the firm side the surplus is the difference between the marginal product
 of labor and the wage paid, summing over all private sectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to divide the firm surplus into two parts: 1) the value of

Suppressing the sector dimension and ignoring taxes makes it clear that
 the heart of the firm's bargaining surplus is the wedge between wages and
 the marginal product of labor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J\left(w_{t}\right)\approx\underbrace{\rho_{t}h_{t}n_{t}}_{\text{scale}}\left(\underbrace{P_{t}^{L}}_{\text{MPL}}-\underbrace{w_{t}}_{\text{wage}}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wedge (between wages and the marginal product of labor) exists due the
 cost of posting vacancies which is a sunk cost in the bargaining situation.
 I.e.
 the firm's expected value of posting a vacancy is zero in equilibrium,
 but the value of a vacancy that has turned into a match is positive.
 The value of a match is often called the matching surplus and it is this
 surplus which is bargained over and divided into a bargaining surplus for
 the worker and a bargaining surplus for the firm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bargaining surpluses are mostly static and wage dynamics primarily enter
 the bargaining problem through an adjustment cost function.
 We define the bargaining loss function as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $G(\cdot)$
\end_inset

 is a wage adjustment cost and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the Nash bargaining power parameter.
 We now specify the adjustment cost function 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{t}\equiv g_{t}+\beta_{t+1}g_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
g_{t}=\frac{\psi^{\omega}}{2}\left[\frac{w_{t}}{w_{t-1}}/\frac{w_{t-1}}{\overline{w}_{t-2}}-1\right]^{2}

where

\end_inset

 are immigrants and

\end_inset

 are emigrants.
 Households making the choice described above are those surviving from the

 Those that survive from on period to another and stay in the country are

 Emigrants 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{a,t}$

 are identical to other residents except that they leave the country.
 Employment for a household of age 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 evolves according to the accumulation-equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{a,t}^{e}=\left(1-\delta_{a,t}\right)q_{a-1,t-1}^{e}+x_{t}q_{a,t}^{s}
\]

\end_inset

Immigrants 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{a,t}$
\end_inset

 come into the country and we assume they obtain the same employment 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a,t}^{e}$
\end_inset

 as residents.
 We also assume that immigrants have the same search behavior as surviving
 households.
 However, they do not have an employment history in the country.
 This implies that some immigrants enter with jobs, so they do not have
 to search.
 This accounts for the employment quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{a,t}^{I}I_{a,t}$
\end_inset

.
 We have then
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{a,t}^{e}=x_{t}q_{a,t}^{s}+q_{a,t}^{I}
\]

\end_inset

This sums to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{N_{a,t}q_{a,t}^{e}}_{n_{a,t}^{e}} & =\left(1-\delta_{a,t}\right)\left(s_{a-1,t-1}-\frac{E_{a,t}}{N_{a-1,t-1}}\right)q_{a-1,t-1}^{e}N_{a-1,t-1}\\
 & +x_{t}\underbrace{q_{a,t}^{s}\left(s_{a-1,t-1}N_{a-1,t-1}+I_{a,t}-E_{a,t}\right)}_{n_{a,t}^{s}\equiv N_{a,t}q_{a,t}^{s}}+q_{a,t}^{I}I_{a,t}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now assume that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
q_{a,t}^{I}\equiv\left(1-\delta_{a,t}\right)q_{a-1,t-1}^{e}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
n_{a,t}^{e} & =\left(1-\delta_{a,t}\right)\left(s_{a-1,t-1}-\frac{E_{a,t}}{N_{a-1,t-1}}+\frac{I_{a,t}}{N_{a-1,t-1}}\right)n_{a-1,t-1}^{e}+x_{t}n_{a,t}^{s}\\
 & =\left(1-\delta_{a,t}\right)\frac{N_{a,t}}{N_{a-1,t-1}}n_{a-1,t-1}^{e}+x_{t}n_{a,t}^{s}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Given this construction, we do not have to know the number of immigrants
 and emigrants.
 All we need to know is the total population.

Imposing the same age distribution on every firm
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of the household's first order condition for participation/search
 is that employment will vary by age.
 However, we do not want to add the sectoral dimension to the disaggregated
 employment variable.
 In order to do this, when we solve the problem of the firm we do not solve
 endogenously for the age distribution of workers inside the different firms/sec
tors indexed by 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 Instead we impose exogenously that this distribution is the same across
 all firms in the economy.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Different sectors will move differently over the cycle.
 And age specific population does not move evenly over time which implies
 neither will the labor force.
 All firms from all sectors hire the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

average job searcher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the currently available pool in the economy.
 As firms from different sectors hire different amounts over time the age
 composition of labor inside firms across sectors will differ, while it
 is the same in all firms within a sector.
 Keeping track of the age distribution within each firm/sector greatly increases
 the dimensionality of the model.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We also choose not to allow for differences in the job destruction rate
 across sectors arising from other factors.
 Evidence from administrative data on wage earners indicates that the average
 age of the labor force is independent of firm size and also uncorrelated
 with whether firms are reducing or expanding their employment.

We force the same distribution using the relationship
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n_{a,s,t}\equiv\frac{n_{s,t}}{n_{t}}n_{a,t}
\]

\end_inset

Given our assumptions, we never have to use the bigger object 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{a,s,t}$
\end_inset

, since on the production side the age distribution does not matter and
 so we only care about total employment inside the firm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Different average wages across sectors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although in our model both labor supply and demand are anonymous, resulting
 in all firms hiring the same average worker looking for a job, and employing
 the same average employed worker in the economy, we observe in the data
 that average wages differ across sectors.
 It is possible that this reflects the heterogeneity of workers employed
 in different sectors, a feature which is ruled out in our model.
 In order to match the data on both employment and average wage acoss sectors
 we need a reduced form mechanism that will allow us to do so without breaking
 the two sided anonymity of the labor market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mechanism described here attaches different productivities to workers
 working in different sectors, while the workers themselves are identical
 wherever they happen to work.
 A three sector example helps illustrate it.
 We first impose the identifying constraint which attaches a relative sectoral
 productivity factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{t}^{i}$
\end_inset

 to sectoral employment, while keeping the total constant:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho_{1,t}^{w}n_{t}^{1}+\rho_{2,t}^{w}n_{t}^{2}+\rho_{3,t}^{w}n_{t}^{3}=\sum_{i}n_{t}^{i}=n_{t}
\]

\end_inset

Given this constraint, calculate the average wage per sector in the data
 and compute the ratios:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\rho_{1,t}^{w}}{\rho_{3,t}^{w}}=\frac{w_{t}^{1}}{w_{t}^{3}}=w_{t}^{13},\;\;\;\;\frac{\rho_{2,t}^{w}}{\rho_{3,t}^{w}}=\frac{w_{t}^{2}}{w_{t}^{3}}=w_{t}^{23}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: the objects 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}^{ij}$
\end_inset

 are data for the period where data exists, and are forecasts for the subsequent
 periods.
 They are an exogenous input into the model.
 This allows for the endogenous calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{3,t}^{w}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\rho_{3,t}^{w}=\frac{n_{t}}{w_{t}^{13}n_{t}^{1}+w_{t}^{23}n_{t}^{2}+n_{t}^{3}}
\]

\end_inset

and of course of the other two as well.
 During data years we use observed average wages and employment, and in
 the forecasting years we use a forecast of relative average wages to calculate
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{j,t}^{w}$
\end_inset

.
 This mechanism preserves the search model.
 It is consistent with the randomness of matching.
 Which means the household problem is unaffected because of the initial
 identifying constraint.
 And it can be interpreted as a proxy for heterogeneity.
