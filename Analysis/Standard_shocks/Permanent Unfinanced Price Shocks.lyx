Permanent unfinanced price shocks
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Permanent unfinanced price shocks"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we look at unfinanced shocks to foreign prices.
 Price shocks all have elements of a negative supply shock, as increased
 prices make production more expensive.
 They also have elements of a positive demand shock as exports increase
 and imports decrease for given domestic prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A shock to foreign prices has the following mechanisms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Initial shock may directly increase export competing prices
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Exports increase
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Initial shock may directly increase import prices
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Substitution away from imports tends to increase demand for domestic goods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher demand prices through imported inputs can decrease domestic demand
 as well as imports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sign of net effects from increased import prices on demand differs for demand
 components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher intermediate input prices through imported inputs
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Higher intermediate input prices have the same proporties as a negative
 shock to productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher intermediate input prices in production
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Higher unit costs in production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher unit costs leads to higher output prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher output prices leads to higher demand prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher prices decrease demand over time
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Higher export competing prices increase domestic demand through exports
 while the domestic demand effect from increased import prices can be positive
 through reduced imports or negative through reduced private consumption
 and / or investments.
 A positive demand shock is described in the introduction and has the following
 proporties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased demand leads to increased sectoral production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased sectoral production leads to increased sectoral production inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased intermediate input inputs leads to increased imports and domestic
 sectoral output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased capital demand leads to increased investments from imports and
 domestic sectoral output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased labor demand leads to increased wages, employment and labor supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased employment and wages leads to higher household income and increased
 demand for private consumption and housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased housing demand leads to increased housing prices and investments
 in housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased housing prices leads to increased liquidity and demand for private
 consumption and housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased production leads to higher output prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher output prices leads to higher demand prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased prices dampens quantity demand over time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Full crowding out in employment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above mechanisms are all described in further detail in the introduction.
 All shocks are unfinanced.
 All the shocks are synthetic shocks as foreign demand and interest rates
 are unchanged.

\begin_layout Subsection
Import prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All import prices are increased by 1 percent relative to the baseline.
 Export competing prices are kept unchanged.
 It affects supply through the prices of intermediate inputs in production.
 It affects demand through substitution away from imports for all relevant
 demand components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Export competing prices are unchanged and exports decrease
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Import share of energy at cell level is fixed
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Aggregate can be affected by composition - but small effect
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The net effect is contractionary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The net effect on different prices depend on their import shares
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
As import prices increase, but wages decrease
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Government consumption has a negative deflator effect
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It has almost no direct imports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has most of its imports from government production, which has almost
 no imports
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
GDP by construction has a negative deflator as imports are a negative part
 of GDP
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Negative effect on public budget and fiscal sustainability

\begin_layout Subsection
Oil price
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The oil price is increased by 10 percent relative to the baseline.
 This affects all foreign prices both import prices and export competing
 prices.
 The shock affects supply through the prices of intermediate inputs in productio
n.
 It affects demand through increased exports and substitution away from
 imports for given domestic prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The import price of energy increases a lot, but other foreign prices also
 increase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pass-through rigid for both foreign and domestic prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Substitution away from imports and intermediate inputs makes employment
 increase in the short run
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Wages increase over time, but real wages fall
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Positive short run effect on government budget
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Subsection
Foreign prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two driving exogenous prices are increased by 1 percent: The oil price
 and the foreign price excluding direct and indirect effects from the oil
 price.
 The import and export competing prices endogenously follow these prices.
 With some rigidity, all foreign prices increase 1 percent.
 This shock affects supply through the prices of intermediate inputs in
 production and it affects demand through increased exports and substitution
 away from imports for given domestic prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pass-through rigid for both foreign and domestic prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All foreign prices increase 1 percent in the long run
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The shock is expansionary in the short run
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Domestic prices are more rigid and net exports will increase - especially
 in the medium term
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firms expect this increase and invest in capital in the short run
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Households are net savers and their real wealth is decreased by the shock
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Lower real wealth gives lower real returns, lower real pension income and
 lower real inheritance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All in all this lowers long run real consumption
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Lower long run demand from consumption makes wages grow with slightly less
 than 1 percent in the long run
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Output prices and export prices increase by slightly less than 1 percent
 in the long run
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Exports increase and import decrease in the long run - to compensate for
 lower private consumption
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Positive short run effect on government budget
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long run effect on government budget and fiscal sustainability is small
