\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we look at unfinanced preference shocks.

\begin_layout Subsection
Household discount factor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The household discount factor is permanently decreased by 1 percentage point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Households are more impatient (discount the future less) and increase their
 consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the short and medium term, this it works as a positive (but gradually
 declining) shock to private consumption and housing demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This sets in motion the following equilibrium responses:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Increased demand leads to increased production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased sectoral production leads to increased sectoral production inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased material inputs leads to increased imports and domestic sectoral
 output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased capital demand leads to increased investmens from imports and
 domestic sectoral output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased labor demand leads to increased wages, employment and labor supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased employment and wages leads to higher household income and increased
 demand for private consumption and housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased housing demand leads to increased housing prices and investments
 in housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased housing prices lead to increased liquidity and demand for private
 consumption and housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased production leads to higher output prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher output prices lead to higher demand prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased demand prices dampen demand over time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Full crowding out in employment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Positive short run effect on government budget
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The increased short and medium term consumption will reduce household wealth
 and long-run consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
55 years after the shock the negative effect on wealth has not stabilized.
 This is because of slow generational effects arising from our overlapping-gener
ations structure.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
We do see the negative effect on consumption, but this has also not stabilized
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Households live many years and give inheritance - so it will stabilize very
 slowly
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the long run it works as a negative shock to private consumption and
 housing demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are negative long-run effect on the government budget and fiscal sustainab
ility

\begin_layout Subsection
Wages through the Nash Negotiation Weight
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Nash negotiation weight is decreased permanently by 1 percentage point
 (workers bargaining power goes up).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Workers receive a larger share of the surplus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On one hand, this increases household income and works as a positive demand
 shock to private consumption and housing - for an isolated analysis of
 this shock, refer to the demand shock via lump-sum transfers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the other hand, it tightens the wedge between the marginal product of
 labor and the wage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This wedge needs to pay for hiring costs so firms reduce their labor demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For most other shocks, reduced labor demand lowers the wages, but here,
 the higher wages are the cause of the lower labor demand and structural
 unemployment increase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The shock also works as a negative supply shock to labor - for an isolated
 analysis of this shock, refer to the supply shock to labor via participation
 (with the opposite sign)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher wages give higher unit costs and higher prices
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This lowers exports and increases import shares
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Real household income increases
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The effect from higher wages and lower employment makes the net-effect from
 wage income very small
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Larger unemployment is compensated and this increase household income this
 dominates effect from higher prices
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The shock is contractionary in employment
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the short run the employment gap is positive as actual employment rigidly
 decrease to its structural level
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the short run, the shock is expansionary in GVA and GDP, as a large permanent
 shift to more capital intensive production increases short term investments
 a lot and firms can increase utilization on labor and capital in the short
 run
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the medium and long term, the shock is also contractionary in GVA and
 GDP as labor input is permanently lower
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is a negative long run effect on the government budget and fiscal
 sustainability
