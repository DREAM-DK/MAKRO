Permanent unfinanced demand shocks
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:Permanent unfinanced demand shocks"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we look at unfinanced demand shocks.
 These are all classic demand shocks as described in the introduction.
 With the following mechanisms described in the introduction:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Initial shock directly or indirectly increases one or more demand components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased demand leads to increased sectoral production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased sectoral production leads to increased demand for production inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased demand for intermediate inputs raises imports and domestic sectoral
 output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased capital demand also raises imports and domestic sectoral output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased labor demand leads to increased wages, employment and labor supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased employment and wages leads to higher household income and increased
 demand for private consumption and housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased housing demand leads to increased housing prices and housing investment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased housing prices and leverage allowed by mortgages lead to increased
 liquidity and additional household demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased production raises unit costs and pushes output prices up from
 the cost side
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher output prices lead to higher demand prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased demand prices dampen quantity demand over time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Full crowding out in employment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first shock we look at is a shock to government lump sum transfers to
 the households.
 Since financed shocks by default take place via lump sum transfers, an
 understanding of this shock is important in relation to all financed shocks.
 The other shocks are other demand shocks.
 Note that all shocks are unfinanced.

\begin_layout Subsection
Lump sum transfers to households
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lump sum transfers to households are increased by 1 percent of the baseline
 GDP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Private consumption and housing investment increase through increased household
 income.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Initial effect on private consumption is less than 1 percent if dampening
 effects from consumption smoothing and habit formation dominate the acceleratin
g effects from increased income through employment, wages and increased
 liquidity through mortgages because of increased house prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long run effect on private consumption is higher than 1 percent of GDP if
 effect from higher long run real wages dominates negative savings effects
 from increased liquidity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Negative effect on government budget and fiscal sustainability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long run effect on GDP is higher than long run effect on GVA.
 This is because:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Demand is shifted from exports to private consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Private demand has more duties than exports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Duties are part of GDP, but not a part of GVA
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Long run GVA is higher as the economy is more capital intensive.
 This is because:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Private consumption of housing has increased much and exports decreased
 (primary effect)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Private consumption of housing draws on the housing sector, which has a
 very high output per worker
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Increased real wage relative to user cost of capital make firms substitute
 from labor to capital (secondary effect)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Government employment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government employment is increased by permanently increasing the government
 payroll with 1 percent of baseline GDP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government consumption and production are increased through increased government
 employment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Negative effect on government budget and fiscal sustainability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long run effect on GDP is negative.
 This is because:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Demand shifted from exports to government consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lower exports decrease production in manufacturing and services
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Production in manufacturing and services has higher output per worker than
 government production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An isolated shock to government employment decrease the capital intensity
 and output per worker in government production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Govenment purchases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government purchases of intermediate inputs are permanently increased by
 1 percent of baseline GDP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government consumption and production increase through higher government
 purchases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main difference between this shock and the government employment shock
 is that here private production increases through intermediate inputs going
 into government production.
 The main input to government purchases is domestic input from the service
 sector.
 In the domestic service sector, increased production can be met by increased
 intermediate inputs, capital and labor, and in the short run also by increased
 factor utilization.
 This means employment needs to increase less in this shock since imports,
 capital, and in the short run utilization, can satisfy the need for increased
 production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Negative effect on government budget and fiscal sustainability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long run effect on GDP is positive as higher duties on government purchases
 than exports increase GDP for given GVA

\begin_layout Subsection
Government investments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government investments are permanently increased by 1 percent of baseline
 GDP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Main shock is directly to government investments that draw mostly on domestic
 construction and services.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Negative effect on government budget and fiscal sustainability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased government investments lead to a gradual increase in government
 capital, government production and government consumption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long run effect on GDP is strong and positive
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Increased government GVA due to higher capital stock - no resources moved
 from private to government sector

\begin_layout Subsection
Foreign demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The export market size is permanently increased, raising exports by 1 percent
 of baseline GDP for given prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Main shock is directly to exports that draw mostly on domestic manufacturing
 and services as well as import to re-exports of manufacturing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Positive effect on government budget and fiscal sustainability
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Short run effect on primary budget due to increased activity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long run effect mainly due to interest revenue from initial surpluses
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Exports increase less than 1 percent in the short run due to rigidity and
 in the long run due to higher domestic wage and prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Positive long run effect on GDP as sea transport has a much larger export
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Sea transport has very little input of labor and domestic production so
 it is affected very little by higher wages.
 It does have capital input, which increases and makes long run GVA and
 GDP increase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is also a small effect from increased housing demand to increased
 capital and GVA in the housing sector
