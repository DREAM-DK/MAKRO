Permanent unfinanced supply shocks
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:Permanent unfinanced supply shocks"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we look at unfinanced labor supply and productivity shocks.
 Both shocks induce lower unit costs.
 The labor supply shock reduces wages and increases the vacancy-filling
 rate, both of which reduce labor costs.
 The productivity shock reduces the quantity of inputs needed to produce
 a unit of output.
 These are all supply shocks, as described in the introduction.
 With the following mechanisms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased supply decreases prices for given demand
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased supply leads to lower unit costs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lower unit costs leads to lower output prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lower output prices lead to lower demand prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lower prices increase demand over time
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Increased demand leads to increased sectoral production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased sectoral production leads to higher demand for inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased intermediate input demand leads to increased imports and domestic
 sectoral output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased capital demand leads to increased investments from imports and
 domestic sectoral output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased labor demand leads to increased wages, employment and labor supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased employment and wages leads to higher household income and increased
 demand for private consumption and housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased housing demand leads to increased housing prices and investments
 in housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased housing prices leads to increased liquidity and demand for private
 consumption and housing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased production leads to higher output prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Higher output prices leads to higher demand prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased prices dampens demand over time
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There is full crowding out in the unemployment rate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increased supply will over time cause scale effects in exports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These mechanisms are all described in further detail in the introduction.
 Note that all shocks are unfinanced - see 'The reaction of the public sector'
 in the introduction.

\begin_layout Subsection
Labor productivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Labor productivity in all private sectors increases by 1 percent relative
 to the baseline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The shock is to domestic labor productivity only - i.e.
 foreign demand market growth, foreign prices, and interest rates unchanged
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Wages per hour worked increase, and real wages increase more as prices decrease
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There is a positive effect on income, private consumption and housing investment
s
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are only small net effects on employment
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the short run, there is less employment for given production.
 Increased production keeps employment relatively stable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the long run, employment is unchanged as structural labor supply is unchanged
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The productivity in the public sector is unchanged - so government production
 and consumption is unchanged
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Private GVA increases close to 1 percent, but total GVA and GDP less
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The government production deflator grows as public sector wages follow private
 sector wages 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Scale effects in exports follow private GVA
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is a positive effect on the government budget and fiscal sustainability

\begin_layout Subsection
Labor supply through participation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Labor supply is increased through participation until each age group's structura
l employment increases by 1 percentage point relative to the baseline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Compared to the labor productivity shock
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There is a negative effect from less unemployment compensation on wages,
 government budget, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This gives an extra effect that works like a negative demand shock via household
 income
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It is a larger shock to effective labor supply as public sector employment
 is unchanged and private sector employment increases by more than 1 percent
 in the long run
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The shock is 'unfinanced' and labor supply increases more than labor demand
 for given prices.
 Thus, both the nominal and real wage will fall.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are small effects on income, private consumption and housing investments
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Employment increases more than real wages decrease - positive effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lower unemployment and unemployment compensation decrease income
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are small effect on investments as production increases, but lower
 real wages induces substitution away from capital in production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
GVA and GDP increase close to proportional with labor supply 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A lower capital-output ratio in the sectors dampens GVA and GDP growth relative
 to labor supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Workers finds employment in the private sector with higher GVA per worker
 than the public sector
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Scale effect in exports increase more than 1 percent as private employment
 and GVA increase more than 1 percent for given public employment and production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Large positive effect on government budget and fiscal sustainability

Capital productivity 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Capital productivity in all private sectors increases by 1 percent relative
 to the baseline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The shock is to domestic capital productivity only - i.e.
 foreign demand market growth, foreign prices and interest rates are unchanged
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Compared to the labor productivity shock:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are smaller long-run effects on GVA as the non-reproducible input
 (effective labor) is unchanged and significantly smaller as substitution
 elasticities in production are small
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Long run price effects are positive
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Qualitatively, most effects are as in the shock to labor productivity
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Wages per hour worked increase and real wages increase
